        "Abstract": "Although α-synuclein levels are elevated in the blood plasma of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, it remains unclear whether blood-derived α-synuclein directly contributes to PD. To investigate this, we developed a novel mouse model in which human α-synuclein levels are increased in the blood. Despite a significant increase in α-synuclein in the blood, no noticeable behavioral abnormalities were observed in aged mice. Additionally, we did not observe plasma α-synuclein aggregation in the blood or entry of human α-synuclein into the brain. These results suggest that elevated blood levels of α-synuclein may not be sufficient to induce PD progression.",

We developed an antibody transport vehicle (ATV) targeting transferrin receptor (TfR) for brain delivery of anti-amyloid-β protein (anti-Aβ) using asymmetrical Fc mutations (ATVcisLALA) that mitigates TfR-related liabilities and retains effector function when bound to Aβ. Administration of ATVcisLALA:Aβ in mice exhibited broad brain distribution and enhanced parenchymal plaque target engagement. This biodistribution reduced ARIA-like lesions and vascular inflammation. Taken together, ATVcisLALA has the potential to improve the next generation of Aβ immunotherapy through enhanced biodistribution mediated by transport across the blood-brain barrier.",

Iron deposition and NM content in the bilateral substantia nigra (SN) showed no differences between PD subgroups.

While accurate, these modalities are expensive and not widely accessible, limiting their utility in routine clinical practice. Here, we present a multimodal computational framework that integrates data from seven distinct cohorts comprising 12, 185 participants to estimate individual PET profiles using more readily available neurological assessments. Our approach achieved an AUROC of 0.79 and 0.84 in classifying Aβ and τ status, respectively. Predicted PET status was consistent with various biomarker profiles and postmortem pathology, and model-identified regional brain volumes aligned with known spatial patterns of tau deposition. This approach can support scalable pre-screening of candidates for anti-amyloid therapies and clinical trials targeting Aβ and τ, offering a practical alternative to direct PET imaging.",

This cross-sectional study analyzed the clinical characteristics of thirty-two patients with PD at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre Malawi using a structured questionnaire and the Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale. The mean age at onset of PD closely matched those reported in other Black African populations but with a higher prevalence of early onset disease. Reported risk factors included pesticide use and a family history of tremor. The majority of patients had severe motor symptoms of PD and chronic comorbidities such as hypertension and HIV/AIDS. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive research on the etiology of PD in Malawi and concerted efforts in addressing its modifiable risk factors.",

Among 358 autopsied participants, the two-step workflow predicted brain LBP with high accuracy overall (94%), and within clinical subgroups (clinical parkinsonism=95%; clinical Alzheimer's disease [AD]=94%; clinically unimpaired [CU]=93%). It reduced the need for confirmatory CSF testing by 43% overall (23% clinical parkinsonism; 35% clinical AD; 80% CU).

        "Abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are both classified as neurological movement disorders, and they may be interconnected due to abnormalities in the dopaminergic system. The incidence of RLS in PD patients is higher than that in the general population. And PD patients with RLS exhibit a higher age of onset, more severe depression, worse nutritional status, lower quality of life, and a relatively lower frequency and severity of RLS symptom. The current research has unveiled several potential mechanisms underlying RLS in PD patients, such as iron deficiency, reduced function of the dopamine system in the A11 region, and decreased connectivity of related pathways and so on. By systematically summarizing the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of PD with RLS, this paper not only provides ideas for the precise diagnosis and treatment of PD with RLS, but also lays a theoretical foundation for clarifying the intricate relationship between PD and RLS.",

Calorie restriction is typically implemented in rodents through feeding once per day; as the animals quickly consume their food, they are subject to a prolonged self-imposed fasting period between meals. Here, we examine the distinct contributions of fasting and reduced calories to the beneficial effects of calorie restriction on Alzheimer's disease by placing male and female 3xTg and non-transgenic control mice on a series of diet regimens enabling us to dissect the effects of calories and fasting. We find that reducing calories alone improves body weight and glucose tolerance. However, a prolonged fast between meals is necessary for many of the benefits of calorie restriction, including improved insulin sensitivity, reduced Alzheimer's pathology, improved neuroprotective signaling, and improved cognition. Overall, our results suggest that both when and how much we eat may influence the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease.",

New formulations of levodopa have recently been marketed that improved the ability to treat PD, but in the European Union, no new active substance for PD has been marketed since 2015, whilst two new agents have been marketed elsewhere. In spite of being the most treatable neurodegenerative disorder, several unmet medical needs still exists in PD, and efforts both from researchers, drug developers and regulators are needed to facilitate further developments in the field. There are several reasons that may account for the lack of new treatments for PD. Regulatory agencies provide scientific advice and have developed several programs to foster drug development. This manuscript discusses the main obstacles identified in the development process, the present status of approvals in European Union and the United States, and the presently available mechanisms to optimize drug development and marketing.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the accumulation and spread of pathological α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils, which contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Here we show that two immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains derived from α-syn receptors, the D1 domain of lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (L3D1) and the V domain of advanced glycation end-products (vRAGE), effectively block cell surface binding of α-syn fibrils, suppress fibrils-induced neuronal α-syn aggregation, and reduce inflammatory responses in microglia. Building on this, we identified two additional Ig-like binders, the D1 domain of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4 D1) and the D1 domain of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR D1), that target the C-terminal region of α-syn fibrils and mitigate fibrils-induced pathological activities. A structure-guided mutant, CAR D1_Mut, exhibits enhanced binding affinity and functional efficacy. These findings highlight the potential of Ig-like binders as molecular tools to interfere with pathological α-syn interactions.",

        "Abstract": "Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of programmed cell death, primarily caused by an imbalance between iron-dependent oxidative damage and antioxidant defense mechanisms within the cell. It differs from previously reported forms of cell death, such as apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, in terms of morphology, biochemistry, and genetics. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by pathological features including neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), senile plaques (SPs), and abnormal iron deposition, suggesting that ferroptosis may be involved in its disease progression. Although recent studies have made significant progress, the mechanisms underlying neuronal ferroptosis in AD remain incompletely understood. This review, based on elucidating the process and regulatory mechanisms of cellular ferroptosis, explores, and supplements the correlation between iron overload and redox imbalance with the main pathological mechanisms of AD, providing new insights for the treatment of AD and the development of new drugs.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) often begins with non-cognitive symptoms such as olfactory deficits, which can predict later cognitive decline, though the mechanisms remain unclear. Pathologically, the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of the neurotransmitter noradrenalin (NA) modulating olfactory information processing is affected early. Here we show early and distinct loss of noradrenergic input to the olfactory bulb (OB) coinciding with impaired olfaction in an AD mouse model, before appearance of amyloid plaques. Mechanistically, OB microglia recognize and phagocytose LC axons. Reducing phagocytosis genetically preserves LC axons and olfaction. Prodromal AD patients display elevated TSPO-PET signals in the OB, similarly to AppNL-G-F mice. We further confirm early LC axon degeneration in post-mortem OBs in patients with early AD. Our findings reveal a mechanism linking early LC damage to hyposmia in AD, suggesting olfactory testing and neurocircuit imaging for early diagnosis and enable timely therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease.",

This study demonstrates the feasibility and clinical relevance of 30-day remote QDG monitoring. Participants showed excellent compliance and found the system easy to use. The QDG Mobility Score demonstrated meaningful correlation with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), captured motor complexities across a broad PD duration, and tracked motor changes from small therapy adjustments. QDG offers providers and PWP an accessible, objective, and real-time tool to remotely monitor motor symptoms, optimize treatment, and address care gaps created by infrequent clinic visits and subjective symptom assessment.",

This article reviews recent research on psychedelic compounds for treatment of headache disorders.\n\nRECENT FINDINGS: Observational data, case reports, and a few recent small, controlled trials suggest symptom benefit at sub-hallucinogenic doses for both migraine and cluster headache. There have not been new completed studies of psychedelics in other headache disorders. Safety signals also tend to be favorable, although there are continuing concerns for systemic and psychiatric effects in varying doses, preparations and clinical contexts. While available studies on psychedelics suggest potential benefit in cluster headache and migraine, access remains complex due to legal considerations, and additional studies are needed to confirm their effectiveness and to ensure safety before they can be recommended for use.",

Saccadic eye movement abnormalities are promising noninvasive biomarkers for PD screening and monitoring. Here, we present an iPad-based system that uses a deep learning algorithm to extract saccade metrics and validate these metrics against the clinical-grade EyeLink 1000 Plus. Twenty-five participants (10 with PD, 15 controls) completed pro-saccade, anti-saccade, memory-guided-saccade, and self-generated-saccade tasks. Relative to the EyeLink, the iPad system achieved average subject-level errors of 2 ms for latency and 0.7∘ for amplitude in pro-, anti-, and memory-guided saccades, and 0.003 s-1 for inter-saccadic rate and 1.6∘ for amplitude in self-generated saccades. A review of 22 studies on PD-related saccadic impairments established benchmarks for clinically meaningful effects. The iPad-based system meets or exceeds these benchmarks, supporting its use as a scalable and cost-effective tool for screening and monitoring PD.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that causes movement disorders. Neurons in PD aggregate α-synuclein and are depleted from the substantia nigra (SN), which is a movement control hub. The presence of α-synuclein-reactive T cells in PD patient blood suggests a role for adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of PD. However, the characteristics of this response within the brain are not well understood. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNAseq, spatial transcriptomics, and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to analyze T cell and glial cell states in post-mortem PD brain tissue. CD8 + T cells were enriched in the PD SN and characterized by clonal expansion and TCR sequences with homology to those reactive to α-synuclein. Furthermore, PD T cells were spatially correlated with CD44+ astrocytes, which increased in the PD SN. Silencing CD44 in cultured astrocytes attenuated neuroinflammatory signatures, suggesting a potential therapeutic target. These findings provide insight into the neurodegenerative niche underlying T cell-mediated neuroinflammation in PD.",

Our investigation examined the relationship between the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index-a marker of insulin resistance-and cognition and striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) alterations in PD through cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. In the primary cohort, higher TyG correlated with lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (p < 0.001) and increased dementia risk (p = 0.014). Longitudinal analysis in the PPMI cohort showed higher baseline TyG predicted greater Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) decline (p = 0.019) and reduced DAT activity in caudate (p = 0.033) and putamen (p = 0.019) over 4 years.DAT activity in the caudate mediated 24.1% of the TyG index's longitudinal effect on MoCA scores, while the TyG index mediated 16.9% of CSF GLP-1R's effect. These results highlight the TyG index as a potential biomarker for identifying PD patients at higher risk of cognitive impairment.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), common neurodegenerative disorder, involves substantia nigra dopaminergic neuron loss and α-synuclein accumulation in Lewy bodies. While pathogenesis remains unclear, dysregulated urea metabolism may play a central role. This study detected elevated serum urea levels in PD patients with upregulated urea cycle enzymes. In MPTP-induced PD mice, urea accumulated in the substantia nigra and striatum, alongside increased activity of urea cycle enzymes (ODC1, ARG1, OTC) and urea transporter UT-B. Mechanistically, brain urea accumulation likely stems from imbalanced urea cycle activity and impaired UT-B-mediated clearance, with compensatory UT-B upregulation specifically in the substantia nigra. In vitro, MPTP-treated neuronal cells showed increased enzyme and UT-B expression, while high urea directly suppressed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Importantly, ODC1 knockdown reversed urea dysmetabolism, restored TH, and alleviated neuronal damage. These findings establish ODC1-mediated urea cycle dysregulation as a core metabolic feature of PD, proposing ODC1 or urea metabolism as novel therapeutic targets.",

This comprehensive review critically evaluates the evolving landscape of surgical approaches in AD treatment, encompassing deep brain stimulation, focused ultrasound, gene therapy delivery systems, neural grafting techniques, and lymphatic-venous anastomosis. We systematically analyze the neurobiological mechanisms, clinical efficacy, safety profiles, and technical challenges associated with these interventions. Drawing upon an extensive review of 112 recent studies, this article provides a rigorous assessment of the current state of surgical therapies for AD, while identifying key knowledge gaps and future research directions that could advance the field toward more effective therapeutic strategies.",

However, accumulating evidence suggests that multiple sclerosis pathophysiology extends beyond such classical lesions, affecting also 'normal' appearing tissue in both white and gray matter, referred to as 'normal-appearing white matter' and 'normal-appearing gray matter', respectively. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the widespread biochemical, cellular, and microstructural alterations occurring in these 'normal-appearing' CNS regions. Additionally, we discuss the evidence derived from human post-mortem studies that support that normal-appearing white and gray matter could be the drivers of smoldering-associated pathological worsening once repair mechanisms are exhausted. Comprehensive understanding of multiple sclerosis pathology beyond classical lesions not only provides a more complete picture of disease progression, but also provides further insights into potential novel therapeutic avenues in order to slow or halt disability accumulation.",

Emerging evidence highlights the significant role of environmental pollutants in AD onset and progression. This review examines the impact of environmental compartments-air, water, soil, and pollutants-on AD pathology. Prolonged exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5), heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic), and engineered nanomaterials (silver, iron oxide, silica) increases AD risk. Additional factors like obesity, smoking, infections, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and electromagnetic fields may exacerbate AD. These exposures potentially drive key pathological features such as amyloid-β plaque deposition and tau protein aggregation. By analyzing recent studies, this review highlights the intersection between environmental exposure and AD progression, emphasizing how such factors can accelerate the disease. It provides practical guidelines to mitigate these risks, aiming to reduce AD incidence while advancing understanding of its environmental contributions.",

We retrospectively analysed bipolar LFP recordings from Parkinson's disease patients across three centres (Netherlands: 68, Switzerland: 21, Germany: 32). Using beta-band power measures (13-35 Hz), we ranked channels based on clinical contact-level choices and developed two prediction algorithms: (i) a \"decision tree\" method for in-clinic use and (ii) a \"pattern based\" method for offline validation. The \"decision tree\" method achieved accuracies of 86.5% (NL), 86.7% (CH), and 75.0% (DE) for predicting the top two contact-levels. Both methods outperformed an existing algorithm.

Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) from post-mortem cortical samples, we informatically estimated the relative circadian phases of 409 persons with and without AD dementia, reconstructing circadian expression profiles across cell types. Although core clock rhythms were preserved in AD, many cell-type-specific circadian outputs were disrupted. Rhythms in ribosomal biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation were dampened across cell types. Similar losses in ribosomal gene expression rhythms were observed in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice, which showed further reductions in ribosomal protein expression and polysome-mediated translation after circadian desynchrony. Exploratory computational modeling reveals that altered translation may contribute to the increased circadian variability seen in AD patients. These findings reveal altered cell-type-specific circadian output rhythms in the brains of AD-affected patients and highlight disrupted ribosomal rhythms as a feature of AD.",

Validation on a large external dataset (N = 1685) confirms its robustness, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models by 7.4% in Dice score and 12.6% in F1 score. It also excels at extracting clinical biomarkers and correlates strongly with clinical stroke scores, closely matching expert performance. Neuroradiologists prefer DeepISLES' segmentations over manual annotations in a Turing-like test.

This study leveraged biobank-scale data to conduct a large multi-ancestry whole-genome sequencing characterization of AD/ADRDs. We thoroughly explored the role of protein-coding and splicing variants from key genes associated with AD/ADRDs across 11 ancestries, utilizing data from five distinct biobanks, including a total of 25,001 cases and 93,542 controls. We compiled the most extensive catalog of known and novel genetic variation in AD/ADRDs in a global context, providing clinical insights into their genetic-phenotypic correlations. A thorough assessment of APOE revealed ancestry-driven modulation of APOE-associated AD/ADRDs, as well as disease-modifying effects conferred by several variants among APOE ε4 carriers.

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline, amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Effective therapies remain limited; therefore, recent studies have explored microRNAs as potential therapeutic targets.\n\nMETHODS: miR-4536-3p inhibition was investigated using in vitro (SH-SY5Y cells) and in vivo (5xFAD mouse) AD models. Apoptosis, neuronal markers, and signaling pathways were assessed through functional assays. Cognitive effects were evaluated via the Morris water maze.\n\nRESULTS: miR-4536-3p inhibition increased an expression of Drebrin1 (DBN1), a key regulator of synaptic plasticity, but it reduced Aβ deposition, tau phosphorylation, and apoptosis. The treatment improved neuronal marker levels and significantly enhanced the spatial learning and memory of 5xFAD mice. Mechanistically, miR-4536-3p inhibition activated the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway, suppressing apoptosis and mitigating AD pathology.\n\nCONCLUSION: miR-4536-3p inhibition offers a promising therapeutic strategy for AD by restoring the DBN1 expression, reducing neurodegeneration, and improving cognitive outcomes through PI3K/Akt pathway modulation.",

This commentary highlights key challenges in functional assessment across cultures and proposes a framework for enhancing their applicability and equity. Method: We critically examine methodological limitations in current functional assessment tools, including poor cultural adaptability, inadequate validation processes, and limited stakeholder engagement. Drawing on existing literature, we propose a multidimensional framework integrating cultural perceptions, robust adaptation strategies, and participatory approaches to improve assessment relevance. Conclusions: Functional assessments must balance cultural specificity with broad applicability to ensure accurate dementia detection across diverse populations. Identifying transcultural markers of functional decline, engaging local communities, and systematically adapting tools through rigorous validation will enhance their diagnostic utility. A culturally inclusive approach to functional assessment can reduce disparities in dementia diagnosis and care worldwide.",

Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of AEP using compound 11a ameliorates AD pathology in murine models. To improve the therapeutic potential of 11a, we synthesized structural analogs and developed a zein-based nanoparticle delivery system to enhance pharmacokinetics. Structural modification, specifically isopropyl substitution of the N-methyl group in 11a, markedly improved blood-brain barrier permeability. The lead compound, 11a-isopropyl, formulated in zein nanoparticles, exhibited superior oral bioavailability and brain exposure. In vivo pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic (PK/PD) analyses confirmed dose-dependent AEP inhibition and enhanced substrate stabilization, with the nanoparticle formulation further increasing efficacy. One-month oral administration in 3xTg AD mice demonstrated that 11a-isopropyl, particularly in nanoparticle form, significantly reduced Aβ and tau pathology and improved cognitive performance. These findings indicate that zein-based nanoparticles enhance AEP inhibitor delivery and therapeutic efficacy in AD.",

Burgeoning clinical data on these amyloid β-protein (Aβ) targeting drugs validate the amyloid cascade hypothesis as a molecular roadmap for the development of yet more effective therapeutics and offer a template for drugging other AD-associated aggregation-prone proteins. While there remains much to be learned about the molecular pathology of AD, the current state of knowledge is sufficient to expedite the delivery of new drugs. Mindful of the urgent need of patients, we recommend prioritizing efforts in four directions: finishing the job on Aβ, accelerating and diversifying efforts on tau, and expanding discovery on apolipoprotein E and ⍺-synuclein. For each target, we explain the scientific premise, current efforts, and possible new approaches. In the short- and medium-term, we advocate focusing on the technical innovations required to better drug these already well validated targets. While the focus of this review is on expediating development of monotherapies, the subsequent approval of such agents will enable add-on or combination approaches best suited to individual patients.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by α-synuclein accumulation and aggregation, leading to disrupted cellular homeostasis, impaired mitochondrial function, and neuroinflammation, ultimately causing neuronal death. Recent biomarker studies reveal elevated serum levels of L-ornithine-derived polyamines correlating with PD progression and clinical subtypes, though their precise role in PD pathology remains unclear. We investigated the impact of polyamine-interconversion enzymes (PAIEs) on α-synucleinopathy in a Drosophila melanogaster model of PD, evaluating key degenerative features such as lifespan, locomotor function, tissue integrity, and α-synuclein accumulation. Knockdown of ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), spermidine synthase (SRM), and spermine oxidase (SMOX) reduced α-synuclein toxicity, while suppression of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1) and spermine synthase (SMS) exacerbated it. Conversely, overexpressing SAT1 or SMOX significantly reduced α-synuclein toxicity, highlighting their potential role in PD. These findings underscore the critical role of polyamine pathways in modulating α-synuclein toxicity, offering novel therapeutic targets for PD.",

Animal models are invaluable in studying underlying pathological processes in human diseases and with evidence for rising life expectancy in many domesticated animals studies have investigated neurocognitive disorders in several non-human species. Rodents have been used extensively as animal models, but this review will examine published literature suggesting candidate non-laboratory animal models for studying dementia, especially human Alzheimer's disease. Comparison of the physiological, pathological and clinical features of companion animals, farm animals and marine mammals shows that although many animals develop amyloid plaques and, to lesser degree, hyperphosphorylated tau protein, very few develop neurofibrillary tangles or neuronal loss to the same extent as humans with Alzheimer's disease. Several hypotheses are proposed as to why, as yet, no animals have been found to spontaneously develop Alzheimer's disease-like pathology to the same level as humans but highlight specific aspects where these models may be useful if developed further.",

Single-nucleus technologies have advanced brain disease research, but remain limited by their low nuclear transcriptional coverage, high cost, and technical complexity. To address this, we applied a transformer-based deep learning model that restores cell type-specific investigation transcriptional programs from bulk RNA-seq, significantly outperforming previous methods. This enables large-scale and cost-effective investigation of cell type-specific transcriptomes in complex and heterogeneous phenotypes such as cognitive resilience or brain resistance to Alzheimer's disease. Our analysis identified astrocytes as the major cell mediator of Alzheimer's disease resilience across cerebral cortex regions, while excitatory neurons and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells emerged as the major cell mediators of resistance, maintaining synaptic function and preserving neuron health. Finally, we show that our approach could restore the whole tissue transcriptome, offering an unbiased framework for exploring cell-specific functions beyond single nucleus data.",

Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) have shown great potential for disease treatment by specifically silencing target genes. However, the poor brain delivery efficiency of siRNAs limits their therapeutic efficacy against AD.\n\nMETHODS: We designed a simplified and effective BACE1 siRNA (siBACE1) delivery system, namely, dendritic polyamidoamine modified with the neurotropic virus-derived peptide RVG29 and polyethylene glycol (PPR@siBACE1).\n\nRESULTS: PPR@siBACE1 crossed the blood-brain barrier efficiently and entered brain parenchyma in large amount, with subsequent neurotropism and potential microglia-targeting ability. Both in vitro and in vivo studies validated the effective brain delivery of siBACE1 and strong BACE1 silencing efficiency. Treatment of AD mice with PPR@siBACE1 inhibited the production of Aβ, potentiated Aβ phagocytosis by microglia, improved the memory deficits and reduced neuroinflammatory response in AD mice.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides a reliable delivery platform for gene therapies for AD.",

AD is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of all cases, which makes it a significant health concern. In recent years, the failure to develop targeted pathological drugs has led researchers to shift their focus. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a specialized structure that separates the circulating blood from the brain tissue and tightly regulates the passage of molecules, ions, and cells between the blood and the brain. Through a comprehensive review of current literature, we highlight the multifaceted role of BBB dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD and discuss the complex mechanisms involved. Changes in the structure and function of endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, along with elevated expression of the highest-risk gene APOE4, can all lead to BBB damage, thereby promoting the onset of AD. Furthermore, we explore potential therapeutic targets to preserve BBB integrity and function to mitigate AD progression. This review underscores the significance of ongoing research efforts in elucidating the intricate interplay between BBB integrity and AD pathology, offering valuable insights for future investigations and therapeutic strategies.",

We analyzed 2,937 plasma proteins assayed in UK Biobank participants with Parkinson's disease, and applied machine learning (ML) to predict disease outcome up to 14 years before diagnosis. 446 proteins were dysregulated in incident cases compared to controls. A subset of 23 proteins predicted disease with an AUC of 0.78 in incident and 0.795 in prevalent cases. We validated the utility of the identified proteomic signatures in an independent cohort on 16 proteins shared across datasets, leading to a validation AUC up to 0.76. We identified overrepresentation of Parkinson's disease-related pathways, including enrichment of Neuron Death and Amyloid-beta Clearance, up to 9 years before the diagnosis. Co-expression network analysis revealed protein modules associated with the disease risk and time-to-diagnosis. Parkinson's disease signatures are found in plasma up to 14 years prior to diagnosis, with dysregulated proteins offering insights into disease development. Our findings underscore the potential of applying ML to large-scale proteomics data from pre-symptomatic patients for early disease prediction.",

This review aims to help neurologists distinguish when dizziness is due to vestibular migraine (VM) versus other vestibular syndromes.\n\nRECENT FINDINGS: VM is now recognized as the most common cause of spontaneous episodic vertigo, with expanding diagnostic criteria, new pathophysiological insights involving CGRP, and emerging treatment strategies including anti-CGRP therapies. It overlaps with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Meniere's disease, persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD), and cerebrovascular events. Novel tools such as the Vestibular Migraine Patient Assessment Tool and Handicap Inventory (VM-PATHI) and frameworks like Timing, Triggers And Targeted Examination (TiTrATE) enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. Differentiating VM from other causes of dizziness relies on a detailed clinical history, neurological examination, and increasingly, awareness of VM's protean features and comorbidities. Recognition is essential as treatments can differ significantly across etiologies. Future research should target biomarkers, subtypes and comparative treatment trials for VM and its mimics.",

        "Abstract": "The Copenhagen Memory Clinic was established in 1995 and since 2007 a new national center for research and education was established, together forming the Danish Dementia Research Centre (DDRC). Our research and innovation programs have continuously been informed by clinical experience and inspired by the needs of our patients. The link between patient care, research, and education forming together a comprehensive dementia center is therefore of crucial importance. In this review, we present an overview of the clinical program at the Copenhagen Memory Clinic, currently receiving 2.000 new referrals per year. We also present the Copenhagen Memory Clinic Cohort and the associated biobank, as well as clinical, translational and epidemiological research programs performed at DDRC during the past 30 years. Funded in part by the Danish Ministry of Health, our national outreach, professional networks and educational programs are also outlined. From its inception and onwards the primary focus of the DDRC has been with the patients, aiming to continuously improve our clinical service based on research and innovation and to improve the quality of care nationwide. We welcome requests for collaboration on research, innovation and education from international colleagues and research centers.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis, a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, it is a mainly B-cell mediated condition with antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor or functionally related molecules at the neuromuscular junction. Corticosteroids are still the most used treatment, as they are cheap and characterized by a rapid response. However, their long-term administration is associated with frequent and often severe side effects.\n\nMETHODS: We used the Expert Opinion methodology: a panel of eight neurologists, known to be experts in the management of MG patients, and one specialist in pharmacoeconomics, were brought together to discuss clinical relevant issues about the use of corticosteroids in MG.\n\nRESULTS: Increasing doses of corticosteroids may temporarily exacerbate the symptoms of MG and clinical exacerbations can lead to severe consequences. In addition, prolonged chronic corticosteroid therapy carries a burden in terms of indirect costs due to side effects, which has prompted strategies to obtain the maximum benefits with minimal side effects.\n\nCONCLUSION: The panel concludes that, in the near future, therapeutic strategies based on the use drugs with better tolerability and potentially lower direct and indirect costs, will be necessary.",

Patients never receiving DMT or starting >2 years post-diagnosis were compared to those initiating DMT within a year of diagnosis.\n\nRESULTS: We identified 193 pwRRMS who never started DMT, 88 had delayed initiation over 2 years, and 1944 started within a year. The no/delayed DMT group was older at diagnosis (mean 38.7 vs 35.2 years, p < 0.001). Corticosteroid-treated relapses were more frequent among early initiators. Optic neuritis was more common in patients with delayed or no DMT. Treatment refusal was the primary reason for delayed/no DMT (35.6%), with 68% of refusers never starting. From 2010to 2019, delayed/no DMT initiation (p = 0.007) and treatment refusal (p = 0.004) decreased significantly.\n\nCONCLUSION: Delayed or absent DMT initiation is linked to older age, optic neuritis, disease inactivity, and treatment refusal, which declined over time, likely due to expanded DMT options.",

        "Abstract": "Nonsense mutations generate premature termination codons (PTCs) that are responsible for 11% of genetic disease alleles. The arginine (Arg, CGA) to stop (UGA) mutation is the most common PTC. Humans encode >600 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes with many identical and similar copies. We developed a dual fluorescent reporter to quantify PTC readthrough in live cells and found single nucleotide mutations of human tRNAArg gene variants enabled differential nonsense suppression that depended on the tRNA sequence and the cell type. We investigated G36A variants of all six human tRNAArgUCG isodecoders, and only the TCG-6-1 tRNA, where G36A occurs in 0.01% of human genomes, was unable to translate nonsense codons. With tRNA sequencing, we showed that a suppressor tRNA derived from the TCG-3-1 gene was expressed 2.1-fold higher and generated 1.8-fold more nonsense suppression than a tRNA derived from the TCG-4-1 gene. In a neuroblastoma model of frontotemporal dementia, we observed >70% readthrough of progranulin R493X with a suppressor tRNA that represented 5%-18% of the total tRNAArg pool. The tRNAs outperformed aminoglycoside-induced nonsense suppression in efficacy, tolerability to the cells, and translation fidelity according to mass spectrometry. Our studies show that human nonsense suppressor tRNAs can correct genetic defects that cause disease.",

        "Abstract": "As Parkinson's disease (PD) advances, there may be a compensatory activation of neurons in the ventral midbrain, potentially linked to the manifestation of non-motor symptoms in individuals with PD. These non-motor symptoms, such as anxiety, often precede the onset of motor symptoms, with female patients generally exhibiting higher levels of anxiety. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain inadequately elucidated. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain functions as a pivotal nucleus capable of encoding both positive and negative emotional signals, potentially contributing to the development of anxiety comorbidities in patients with PD. In this study, we utilized a combination of chemogenetics, behavioral assessments, and morphological analyses to demonstrate that the heightened activity of VTA neuron populations, especially dopaminergic neurons induces sex-specific anxiety-related behaviors in mice. This phenomenon may be associated with the activation of the VTA-NAC and VTA-vHPC neural circuits. Our findings highlight the critical role of VTA neuron populations, especially dopaminergic neurons in early PD-related anxiety. They offer a valuable experimental framework for elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety in PD, thereby establishing a foundation for the development of early intervention strategies.",

Specifically, the risk of having an ischemic stroke due to (likely) large artery disease, compared with women with a cryptogenic stroke, was increased for women with a history of HDP, SGA, and preterm birth.\n\nDISCUSSION: A history of pregnancy complications may identify women at increased risk of ischemic stroke at young age, in particular atherosclerotic stroke.",

        "Abstract": "The microtubule-associated protein tau plays a central role in neurodegenerative diseases, called tauopathies, but the mechanism involved remains incompletely understood. Here, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to investigate the consequences of expressing the shortest human tau isoform 0N3R. After transfected, we detected widespread cellular distribution of tau and phosphorylation at key pathological residues involved in Alzheimer's disease (Ser199/202). We also found that a portion of tau localizes within the mitochondrial matrix. The mitochondrial uptake of tau required a chaperone machinery, including Hsp104 and the Ssa1/Ydj1 bichaperone complex. Functionally, tau expression caused marked mitochondrial fragmentation, reduced oxygen consumption, and a decrease in membrane potential during stationary phase, indicating impaired mitochondrial function. This dysfunction activated the yeast retrograde signaling pathway. Importantly, tau expression enhanced mitochondrial clearance through mitophagy, both under nitrogen starvation and during stationary phase, and this effect was dependent on the retrograde response. Together, these findings demonstrate that tau expression in yeast perturbs mitochondrial homeostasis, triggering both compensatory nuclear signaling and increased mitochondrial turnover, adding evidence on the potential mechanisms involved in tau neurotoxicity.",

This study aims to reveal the causal relationship between OM and AD.\n\nMETHODS: A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was employed to examine the association between 594 OM exposures and AD outcomes. Effect estimates were derived from external genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, primarily utilizing inverse-variance weighted (IVW) analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. In addition, we genetically mapped SNPs corresponding to OM in the MR analysis to identify genes that may link OM to AD.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 48 OM exposures exhibited statistically significant associations with AD outcomes (p ≤ 0.05). Of these, 30 were identified at the genus level, 12 at the species level, and six at the family level. Genetic function analyses indicated that OM-related genes are closely linked to the regulation of neurobiological functions, supporting a potential role for OM in the pathogenesis of AD.\n\nCONCLUSION: The findings presented here provide genetic evidence for a causal relationship between OM and AD, offering insights that may guide the future development of prevention and treatment strategies targeting OM in the context of AD.",

        "Abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a frequent non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and a potential early marker of synucleinopathy-related neurodegeneration. While striatal dopaminergic dysfunction in PD-RBD has been extensively studied, the role of extrastriatal monoaminergic alterations -particularly those involving serotonin - remains poorly understood. In this study, 155 PD patients underwent [123I]FP-CIT SPECT imaging to assess striatal and extrastriatal tracer binding, reflecting dopaminergic and broader monoaminergic function, respectively. Probable RBD was identified using a validated single-question screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity. Patients with probable RBD (RBD + , n = 44) were compared to those without (RBD - , n = 111) using voxel-wise and region-of-interest analyses, controlling for age, sex, disease duration, motor and non-motor symptom severity, and cognitive function. No significant differences were observed in striatal dopamine transporter binding. However, RBD+ patients showed significantly higher extrastriatal binding in the prefrontal cortex (pFWE < 0.05), suggesting a potential role for altered extrastriatal monoaminergic neurotransmission, possibly involving serotonergic pathways, in PD-RBD pathophysiology. These findings should be interpreted with caution due to the non-selective binding profile of the radiotracer.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder closely associated with oxidative stress, which plays a pivotal role in neuronal damage and disease progression. The Keap1-Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating cellular responses to oxidative stress. Keap1 inhibits Nrf2 by maintaining its low expression, thus controlling antioxidant gene expression. Cistanche flavonoids, natural polyphenolic compounds, have been shown to activate this pathway. They suppress Keap1, preventing Nrf2 degradation and promoting its translocation to the nucleus, where it activates the antioxidant response element (ARE). This process significantly increases the production of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Elevated enzyme levels enhance cellular antioxidant defenses, reduce oxidative damage at the cellular and neuronal levels, and improve cognitive function in AD mouse models. The study examined the molecular composition of Cistanche flavonoids and their impact on the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway, revealing their potential in mitigating AD-related changes. By neutralizing free radicals and enhancing antioxidant defenses, Cistanche flavonoids may offer a promising approach to counteract AD pathology. This comprehensive analysis underscores their therapeutic potential in alleviating AD through oxidative stress reduction and antioxidant activation.",

        "Abstract": "There is growing interest in the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM), and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) may be an important link between these two diseases. The role of GLP-1R in DM is principally to regulate glycemic control by stimulating insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, and improving insulin signaling, thereby reducing blood glucose levels. In AD, GLP-1R attenuates the pathological features of AD through mechanisms such as anti-inflammatory effects, the reduction in amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, the promotion of Aβ clearance, and improvements in insulin signaling. Notably, AD and DM share numerous pathophysiological mechanisms, most notably the disruption of insulin signaling pathways in the brain. These findings further underscore the notion that GLP-1R plays pivotal roles in both diseases. Taken together, these findings lead us to conclude that GLP-1R not only plays an important role in the treatment of DM and AD but also may serve as a bridge between these two diseases. Future research should focus on elucidating the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of GLP-1R in both diseases and exploring the development of GLP-1R agonists with dual therapeutic benefits for AD and DM. This could pave the way for innovative integrated treatment strategies to improve outcomes for patients affected by these intertwined conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) demonstrate an ever-evolving disease continuum. The presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative diseases provides a window of opportunity to detect disease-specific changes and abnormalities early on and potentially intervene right away, before clinical symptoms occur. Age and sex are key modifiers of the presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative diseases. In presymptomatic MS, younger age and male sex are main risk factors for transition to symptomatic MS, whereas older age and male sex are important predictors of the direct transition from presmyptomatic MS to primary progressive MS. In cognitively unimpaired adults, age is the strongest risk factor for AD and the lifetime AD risk after>65 years is higher in women versus men. The prevalence and future disease severity of AD is further modified by factors such as apolipoprotein Eɛ4, ovarian hormones, and menopause in women. Biomarkers are instrumental in detecting and monitoring abnormalities and underlying disease mechanisms in vivo, that are already present in the presymptomatic phase. Evaluating the influence of age and sex on presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly through biomarkers, contributes to the enhanced patient selection for clinical trials, optimization and individualization of patient management and development of new therapeutics.",

        "Abstract": "Emerging evidence is challenging the long-standing notion that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by increased γ-secretase function and overproduction of 42-amino acid amyloid-beta (Aβ42). Cerebrospinal fluid levels of soluble monomeric Aβ42 in AD are reduced to about half of those in healthy individuals and drop even further at dementia onset in genetic forms (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 mutations) and in Down's syndrome. Findings supporting a revised AD pathophysiology include: (1) ∼90% of pathogenic PSEN1 mutations reduce γ-secretase activity and Aβ42 production; (2) lower γ-secretase activity is correlated with lower soluble Aβ42 levels, earlier onset of dementia, worse cognition, and faster progression; (3) higher soluble Aβ42 levels associate with preserved cognition and delayed dementia in amyloid-positive sporadic and familial AD; (4) apparent cognitive benefits from anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies may involve increased soluble Aβ42 levels; and (5) monomeric Aβ42 supports memory and other functions akin to a neuropeptide. These findings suggest that restoring, not reducing, γ-secretase activity and monomeric Aβ42 levels above a compensation threshold could offer disease-modifying therapeutic benefits. Drugs that increase soluble Aβ42, some already approved for other indications and linked to reduced dementia risk, may be repurposed to test whether they can slow disease progression in familial and sporadic AD.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: An earlier age of menopause (AOM) is hypothesized to increase vulnerability to the neuropathological processes of dementia, which begin in midlife.\n\nMETHODS: We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 10,832 women from the Swedish Twin Registry, stratified by menopause etiology.\n\nRESULTS: Survival models showed that a U-shaped association was present for women whose menopause occurred spontaneously. Sensitivity analyses conducted in hormone naïve, apolipoprotein E ε4+, and AOM restricted subsamples showed largely analogous patterns of results.\n\nDISCUSSION: Supporting conclusions from basic research, our results suggest that estrogens (proxied here by AOM) influence several biological pathways mediating dementia disease processes. In line with trends in hormone research across the past century, our findings challenge the oversimplified \"more-is-better\" perspective on hormone exposure and highlight the need for cross-disciplinary approaches to better understand the interacting endocrine and biopsychosocial factors that underlie the association between AOM and dementia pathogenesis.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: We found a U-shaped association of timing of spontaneous menopause and dementia risk.

        "Abstract": "Emerging evidence implicates pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38) in migraine and other headache disorders. Systemic infusion of PACAP-38 induces migraine headache in people with migraine and mild headache in healthy adults. However, the precise mechanism and site of action remain poorly characterized. To address this gap, we assessed whether PACAP-38 elicits headache by activating meningeal nociceptors. In vivo single-unit electrophysiological recordings were obtained from C- and Aδ-meningeal nociceptors in the trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized male and female rats. Spontaneous firing rates and mechanical responses to dural indentation with von Frey filaments were recorded before and for 4 hours after a 20-minute intracarotid infusion of PACAP-38 (1 µg/ml/kg, 10 µg/ml/kg, and 100 µg/ml/kg) or vehicle (isotonic saline). At the human-equivalent dose (10 µg/ml/kg), PACAP-38 activated 15 of 30 (50%) neurons, compared with none after vehicle (P < 0.01). Activation rates did not differ between C-fibers (7 of 17; 41%) and Aδ-fibers (8 of 13; 61.5%). The lowest dose of PACAP-38 (1 µg/ml/kg) activated 3 of 9 (33%) neurons, whereas the highest dose (100 µg/ml/kg) activated all four tested neurons, including two C-fibers and two Aδ-fibers. These results suggest that PACAP-38 induces headache through peripheral activation of meningeal nociceptors rather than exerting direct central effects within the spinal trigeminal nucleus.",

Plasma AM concentrations were quantified using a validated immunoluminometric assay by trained personnel who were blinded to group status.ResultsIn total, 667 participants with migraine and 147 HCs provided data eligible for analysis. Plasma AM concentrations did not differ significantly between the migraine and HC group (18.2 ± 9.1 pg/ml vs. 18.5 ± 8.4 pg/ml; p = 0.08). However, participants with episodic migraine exhibited lower AM levels than HCs (16.9 ± 7.7 pg/ml vs. 18.5 ± 8.4 pg/ml; p = 0.04). Multivariate regression models showed that plasma AM concentrations are positively associated with body mass index (4.2% increase in AM per kg/m2; 3.6 to 4.8%; p < 0.001) and monthly migraine days (0.6% increase in AM per MMD; 0.2 to 1.0%; p = 0.006).ConclusionsPlasma AM concentrations were comparable between participants with migraine and HCs; however, those with episodic migraine exhibited slightly lower levels.

Healthcare providers face challenges in effective communication and connecting patients to post-diagnostic resources. To address these issues and emphasize person-centered communication, especially in diverse communities, we conducted a rapid systematic review consolidating preferences for dementia diagnosis disclosure from patients, care partners, and healthcare providers. Searches across MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Emcare (January 2013-February 2023), and gray literature identified 21 relevant articles, including those focusing on Black and Chinese populations. Four themes emerged: (1) setting up appointments, (2) appointment content, (3) overall approach, and (4) cultural competence in dementia disclosure. The Setting, Perception, Invitation, Knowledge, Emotions, and Strategy/Summary (SPIKES)-D tool was noted but lacked real-world evaluations and cultural applicability. Our review highlights the need for tailored tools and standardized guidelines, particularly for culturally competent dementia disclosure practices.

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction, with spatial memory impairments among the earliest detectable deficits. The dentate gyrus (DG), a critical region for spatial discrimination, exhibits functional alterations in patients with AD. Adult-born granule cells (abGCs) with higher intrinsic excitability are involved in DG-dependent spatial memory. However, it remains unclear the changes in intrinsic excitability of abGCs and underlying mechanisms at early stage of AD. In this study, 4-month-old APP/PS1 male mice exhibited spatial memory impairment and alterations in DG network activity. The inward rectifier K+ channel 2.1 (Kir 2.1) channels were upregulated in the hippocampus of the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Pharmacological inhibition of Kir 2.1 using ML133 significantly ameliorated spatial memory impairment and reversed the network activity of DG region. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of 6-week-old abGCs revealed that intrinsic excitability was decreased in APP/PS1 mice relative to wild-type controls, which was attributable to excessive activation of Kir 2.1. These findings suggest that aberrant intrinsic excitability in the subgroup of abGCs may contribute to DG network activity alterations and induce spatial memory impairment. Our results identify Kir 2.1 overactivation in abGCs as a potential pathogenic mechanism and therapeutic target for early cognitive decline in early stage of AD.",

Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a slowly propagating depolarization wave underlying migraine aura. We investigated whether the efficacy of atogepant in migraine is mediated by CSD suppression.\n\nMETHOD: We used Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 28 males, 28 females) to determine the electrical stimulation intensity threshold for CSD induction and the frequency of CSDs induced by continuous topical 1 M KCl application sequentially in the same animal, using intracortical glass microelectrodes under isoflurane anesthesia and full systemic physiological monitoring, including arterial blood pressure and blood gases. In a separate cohort, we disrupted the BBB by inducing three CSDs in the contralateral hemisphere using 1 M KCl daily for 2 days before CSD susceptibility testing. Both cohorts received atogepant (30 mg/kg, once daily oral gavage) or vehicle for four days. CSD susceptibility was examined 1 h after the last atogepant dose.\n\nRESULTS: Atogepant did not affect the CSD threshold, frequency, propagation speed, amplitude, or duration compared with vehicle, either without or with preceding CSDs. Systemic physiological parameters did not differ between groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that atogepant efficacy in migraine is not mediated via CSD suppression, even when BBB permeability is increased.",

In this study, we used a neuroblastoma-derived cell model overexpressing a pro-aggregation form of alpha-synuclein and human-derived induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to investigate the efficacy of PIKfyve-mediated lysosomal biogenesis to reduce alpha-synuclein inclusions.\n\nMETHODS: We used high-content imaging and enzymatic assays to follow the progression of lysosomal biogenesis, lysosomal catabolism and alpha-synuclein accumulation. The cell models used recapitulated important elements of the biochemical phenotype observed in PD dopaminergic neurons, including alpha-synuclein inclusions and impaired glucocerebrosidase.\n\nRESULTS: PIKfyve inhibition by YM201636 resulted in a lysosomal-dependant reduction of alpha-synuclein inclusions as early as 24 h post-treatment. YM201636 induced an increase in nuclear translocation of TFEB, and an increase in lysosomal markers LAMP1 and HEXA. PIKfyve-inhibition was also tested in neuronal-differentiated neuroblastoma-derived cells and iPSCs-derived dopaminergic neurons.

        "Abstract": "Caregivers of individuals with dementia often face the dual challenge of managing dementia alongside sensory impairments (hearing and/or vision loss). Despite the significant burden, this issue remains underexplored, with existing research largely overlooking the impact of sensory impairments on caregivers' experiences. This systematic review examines the challenges and needs of caregivers managing both conditions. A comprehensive literature search across three databases identified 12 studies published before May 2024 in five countries. The review revealed that caregivers face increased challenges when managing both dementia and sensory impairments. Unmet needs, particularly in accessing tailored support and assistive technologies, were prevalent. Multidisciplinary care and interventions are crucial to address both cognitive and sensory needs. To improve the quality of life for caregivers and sensory impaired dementia patients, comprehensive support systems, enhanced caregiver education, and better access to affordable assistive technologies are essential. Addressing these disparities is critical for providing effective care. HIGHLIGHTS: This review focuses on informal caregiving for people with dementia and sensory loss. Caregivers face increased challenges due to managing both dementia and sensory impairments. There are additive implications of caring for people with dual impairments. Further research is needed on interventions to support this caregiver population.",

        "Abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is an essential regulator in cellular signaling and a major contributor to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. 14-3-3 proteins are critical modulators of LRRK2 activity, yet the structural basis of their interaction has remained unclear. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the LRRK2:14-3-32 autoinhibitory complex, revealing how a 14-3-3 dimer stabilizes an autoinhibited LRRK2 monomer through dual-site anchoring. The dimer engages both phosphorylated S910/S935 sites and the COR-A/B subdomains within the Roc-COR GTPase region. This spatial configuration constrains LRR domain mobility, reinforces the inactive conformation, and likely impedes LRRK2 dimerization and oligomer formation. Structure-guided mutagenesis studies show that PD-associated mutations at the COR:14-3-32 interface and within the GTPase domain weaken 14-3-3 binding and impair its inhibitory effect on LRRK2 kinase activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that type I LRRK2 kinase inhibitor, which stabilizes the kinase domain in its active conformation, reduces 14-3-3 binding and promotes dephosphorylation at pS910 and pS935. Together, these findings provide a structural basis for understanding how LRRK2 is maintained in an inactive state, elucidate the mechanistic role of 14-3-3 in LRRK2 regulation, inform the interpretation of PD biomarkers, and suggest therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing LRRK2-14-3-3 interactions to treat PD and related disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition manifesting as cognitive decline, memory deterioration, and behavioral alterations. Late-onset AD accounts for most diagnosed cases, with the onset of symptoms usually occurring after 65 years. At present, there are no proven treatments that alter the course of AD. For early detection and intervention, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms and identify promising biomarkers for AD. Research suggests that the pathological processes of AD initiate years before the emergence of noticeable symptoms, which makes the early diagnosis more challenging. While various biomarkers, such as cognitive tests, imaging, and biological markers in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, have been proposed for early detection, their reliability, as matched with symptomatic stages, varies significantly. As a component of the central nervous system, the retina has attracted attention as a potential site for studying AD-related changes. Studies from human and animal models have revealed structural, vascular, functional, and metabolic changes in the retina through the early phases of AD. Furthermore, advances in ophthalmic technologies have facilitated the identification and characterization of AD-related changes such as amyloid-β and tau-protein deposition. This review provides an overview and perspective on AD as they relate to the retina and highlights the importance of ocular changes as surrogates for understanding and diagnosing AD.",

The 2023 RIS criteria enhance diagnostic precision against imaging mimics by requiring one T2-weighted hyperintense lesion in two of four specified locations (periventricular, juxtacortical/cortical, infratentorial, spinal cord) alongside at least two of the following: a spinal cord lesion, CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands (OCB), or a new T2/gadolinium-enhancing lesion on MRI at any point, defining dissemination in time (DIT). After confirming the diagnosis, established risk factors for transition to clinical MS need to be assessed. Key factors include a younger age, male sex, the presence of infratentorial, spinal cord, or gadolinium-enhancing lesions, and CSF-restricted OCBs or increased kappa-free light chains. Two randomized trials showed the efficacy of two oral disease-modifying therapies in delaying the first clinical event in RIS. However, as some individuals remain asymptomatic, it's crucial to identify suitable candidates to balance treatment benefits with potential risks. Reviewing each RIS case with an MS expert team is advisable for better care and monitoring. The updated 2024 McDonald criteria classify RIS patients with additional features, such as positive CSF and susceptibility MRI biomarkers, as having preclinical MS.",

        "Abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration and a median survival of 3-5 years post-diagnosis. While the etiology of ALS remains elusive, mutations in SOD1, encoding the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase enzyme, are strongly associated with familial ALS (fALS). These mutations promote a toxic gain-of-function, primarily through SOD1 misfolding and aggregation. We systematically assessed 244 SOD1 missense mutations using a multi-tiered computational framework encompassing structural, functional, and pathogenic predictors. Sequence-based predictors (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, FATHMM) and structure-guided tools (mCSM, PremPS, DynaMut2) identified 79 destabilizing mutations, 64 of which were classified as pathogenic by phenotype predictors (PhD-SNP, SNPs&GO, MutPred2). Twelve mutations resided in evolutionarily conserved regions, with eight (D84N, G73C, H72Y, P67A, P67R, P67S, R144G, S60I) exhibiting pronounced aggregation propensity via SODA analysis. Notably, H72Y disrupts a zinc-binding residue critical for structural integrity and catalysis. Protein-protein interaction networks linked SOD1 to ALS-associated pathways, highlighting its involvement in oxidative stress and protein homeostasis. Our integrative approach highlights the power of computational genomics in unraveling mutation-driven SOD1 dysfunction, offering mechanistic insights into ALS pathogenesis and guiding therapeutic strategies focused on aggregation-prone variants.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Identifying dementia neuropathology is critical for guiding effective therapies and clinical trials. To tackle this, we developed semi-supervised models for identifying neuropathology using low-burden data to improve generalizability.\n\nMETHODS: We defined low-burden data as being reasonably obtainable at a primary care setting. By using a semi-supervised learning paradigm, we can amplify the utility of low-burden data. We trained a clustering and a semi-supervised prediction model to yield clustering and prediction results for different neuropathology lesion types.\n\nRESULTS: Our clustering model identified two clinically meaningful outlier groups that were either neuropathology-enriched or -scarce. We predicted neuropathology burden across different pathology types and found that using low-burden data over multiple clinical visits can predict neuropathology on par with using higher-burden data.\n\nDISCUSSION: This work fills a critical gap in the field by using low-burden clinical data to predict neuropathology, thereby improving dementia screening, therapy, and targeted clinical trials.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: Clinical data are useful for neuropathology screening in future clinical trials. Novel application of semi-supervised learning for identifying neuropathology. Clustering model found groups with highly different neuropathology prevalence. Low-burden data can provide relatively accurate predictions of pathology load. Higher-burden, longitudinal data are most helpful for predicting vascular lesions.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder causing neuronal loss and cognitive deficits, which is associated with intestinal flora dysbiosis. Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma (ATR) is the dried rhizome of Acorus tatarinowii Schott., and exhibits neuroprotective effects. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic mechanism of ATR in AD. AD rat models were constructed by intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-42, with gavage of ATR water extract (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) for 21 days. Behavior tests, HE staining, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and 16S rRNA sequencing were performed. In AD rats, ATR improved cognitive dysfunction and brain histopathological damage, with reduced Aβ1-42, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, malondialdehyde, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule, and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, and higher superoxide dismutase activity, indicating inhibition of neuroinflammation by ATR. Moreover, Ruminococcus was strongly associated with ATR treatment for AD, which mainly enriched in Carbohydrate metabolism, Amino acid metabolism, and Lipid metabolism. Meanwhile, Dorea was negatively correlated with behavioural indicators and positively correlated with inflammatory factors, whereas g_Adlercreutzia showed the opposite trend. These findings suggested that ATR may attenuate neuroinflammation and improved AD by modulating intestinal flora and inhibiting microglia and astrocyte activation, providing a scientific basis for its clinical application in AD.",

His symptoms progressed in severity and he ultimately required intubation due to declining lung function and inability to manage his secretions. Clinical examination revealed bulbar dysfunction without involvement of other cranial nerves. A lumbar puncture revealed albuminocytological dissociation: elevated protein (9.8 g/L), nonerythroid cell count (13 cells/µL) with predominantly lymphocytic count. He received a five-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin for presumed Guillain-Barré syndrome. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild microangiopathic changes in the brain with no parenchymal, leptomeningeal, or cranial nerve enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was positive for varicella zoster virus (VZV). He was treated with intravenous Acyclovir 10 mg/kg three times daily for 14 days with no initial improvement and underwent a tracheostomy. Subsequent MRI was consistent with rhombencephalitis.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: VZV rhombencephalitis with cranial neuropathies represents a rare and potentially fatal condition.

        "Abstract": "Impaired descending inhibitory controls are now understood to exacerbate central sensitization of chronic migraine, yet the underlying neural and molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. Herein, a paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) oxytocin (OXT) → trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) GABA neural circuit was identified through the application of a rigorous anterograde tracing strategy and RNAscope in situ hybridization techniques, involved in regulating trigeminal nociceptive transmission. In both episodic and chronic migraine mouse models induced by nitroglycerin (NTG) injections, increased activity of the PVN OXT → TNC GABA circuit was observed. However, the activity of PVN OXT neurons decreased in chronic migraine mice when compared to episodic migraine mice. Chemogenetic activation of PVN OXT neurons alleviated migraine hyperalgesia and enhanced the release of OXT and GABA in TNC in chronic migraine mice, while these beneficial effects were abrogated by the intra-TNC administration of OXT receptor antagonist. Interestingly, the expression of prostaglandin F2α receptor (FP) in PVN OXT neurons decreased with the chronification of migraine despite upregulation of PVN prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) levels. Targeting FP overexpression in PVN OXT neurons restored neuronal activity and ameliorated chronic migraine hyperalgesia. Overall, our study reveals a novel neural and molecular mechanism for descending modulation of trigeminal central sensitization, thereby providing a basis for treating chronic migraine.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Semantic intrusion errors (SIEs) are associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is unknown whether accounting for maximum learning capacity still leads to an increase in SIEs when elevated plasma p-tau217, a biological indicator of underlying AD, is present.\n\nMETHODS: One hundred fifty-eight older adult participants completed the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L), a sensitive cognitive challenge test designed to elicit SIEs. Of these, 108 were clinically diagnosed with amnestic MCI (aMCI). Fifty-eight individuals met or exceeded a plasma p-tau217 positivity of >0.55 pg/ml, while 50 individuals scored below this threshold.\n\nRESULTS: After adjusting for demographic covariates and maximum learning capacity, the aMCI p-tau217+ group evidenced more SIEs compared to aMCI p-tau217- on the first (list B1; p = 0.035) and second trials of the competing list (list B2; p = 0.006). Biological predictors such as ApoE ε4 status, higher p-tau217, and older age were predictors of an elevated number of SIEs [list B2: F (3,104) = 10.92; p = 0.001; R = 0.489)].\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Unlike previous studies that used amyloid PET or other plasma biomarkers, individuals with aMCI p-tau217+ evidenced more SIEs, even after adjusting for their initial learning capacity, a covariate that has not been studied previously. These findings support that SIEs are more prevalent in the presence of underlying AD pathology and occur independent of learning deficits.",

The primary outcome was incident AD dementia. The accepted cutoff values of an MMSE score of 28 and an MoCA score of 26 for MCI were considered.ResultsAfter excluding those who did not undergo the test, 940 patients were included. During a median follow-up period of 4.6 years, incident AD dementia occurred in 49 patients. Patients diagnosed with MCI with MMSE scores <28 or MoCA scores <26 showed a significantly higher risk of AD dementia than those with normal MMSE or MoCA groups. However, patients who met the MCI criteria in only one test showed a risk similar to that of the normal group. In contrast, patients who met the MCI criteria for MMSE and MoCA scores had a 20.65-fold higher risk than those with normal MMSE and MoCA scores.ConclusionsPatients who met the MCI criteria for both the MMSE and MoCA were highly susceptible to incident AD dementia.Clinical Trial RegistrationUMIN000026671.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a large and burgeoning field, where varied methodological approaches are providing multifaceted, but sometimes contradictory, views on the etiology and progression of pathology. The current review aims to summarize and integrate these findings to provide greater coherence to an increasingly splintered field. We provide an overview of the findings from each subfield (neuropathology, positron emission tomography imaging, fluid biomarkers, genetics, transcriptomics/proteomics), highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and, where possible, trying to resolve discrepancies between subfields. In particular, we address arguments about whether amyloid versus tau initiates pathology, and integrate nanoscale data from aging macaques to improve clarity regarding the earliest pathological stages, as initial phosphorylation events can be lost post mortem in human tissue. We find that Aβ42, phosphorylated tau, and inflammation/excessive calcium can all interact in feedforward cycles to drive AD pathology. Increasing cohesion across subdisciplines will strengthen our understanding of this devastating disease. HIGHLIGHTS: AD research is an expansive field, where subfields often diverge. The current review integrates across approaches to give a more cohesive view. Many methods cannot detect the earliest changes in brain. The new fluid biomarker pT217Tau shows that soluble tau pathology begins early. Relating amyloid/tau pathologies to inflammation is key for understanding sporadic AD.",

        "Abstract": "CLARITY is a technique that makes tissues optically transparent, enabling the clear visualization of complex cellular and subcellular structures with relative ease. Traditionally, this technique has been used to visualize the pathologies of certain diseases. In the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the CLARITY technique of clearing lipids from tissues has enabled precise visualization of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies with a temporal analysis of the extent of protein aggregation associated with disease progression. This information has been invaluable for determining the progression of AD. Moreover, the structural characteristics of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles provide details about aggregation patterns. Here, we highlight critical insights into the potential applications of the CLARITY technique in conjunction with other modalities. We elucidated microscopy techniques, namely confocal microscopy and light-sheet microscopy, which are often used to detect fluorescently labeled compounds within cells, aiding in the qualitative and quantitative estimation of target proteins. Additionally, we discuss the application of super-resolution expansion microscopy (SREM) to increase the resolution of tissue images without compromising molecular specificity. We also expounded on the application of CLARITY-based imaging in improving optogenetics and organoid development. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of CLARITY in assisting the formulation and validation of machine learning algorithms and conducting hypothesis testing.",

        "Abstract": "A patient with multiple sclerosis may experience motor, sensory, speech, and visual symptoms depending on the location of central nervous system demyelinating plaque involvement. The most common clinical presentation with visual symptoms is unilateral optic neuritis. However, uveitis rarely causes visual impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis-associated uveitis may occur after the diagnosis or years before the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. We report a case of multiple sclerosis that was diagnosed 10 years after uveitis attacks. A 21-year-old female complained of numbness in her left half of the body for 3 days. Her medical history, it was noted that she had been treated for uveitis attacks and glaucoma and retinal detachment 10 years ago. Diagnostic studies for uveitis attacks did not reveal any etiology. Azathioprine and colchicine were recommended to prevent uveitis attacks and the patient was still taking these two medications regularly. Magnetic resonance imaging performed due to focal neurological symptoms showed images compatible with multiple sclerosis plaques. Oligoclonal band type 3 in the cerebrospinal fluid. She was evaluated by an ophthalmologist and a rheumatologist. No rheumatological cause was found. Ophthalmological evaluation was consistent with previous anterior and intermediate uveitis. Previous uveitis attacks were considered multiple sclerosis-associated uveitis. We recommended follow-up with interferon 1β treatment, which is effective in both multiple sclerosis and multiple sclerosis-associated uveitis.",

However, their interrelationships and combined impact on clinical features remain unclear.\n\nMETHODS: Glymphatic activity was measured by diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) in patients with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD, n = 61) and normal controls (NC, n = 61).\n\nRESULTS: Glymphatic activity in bvFTD correlated strongly with vascular dysfunction and astrocytic activation, and was associated with brain changes and clinical severity. Astrocytic activation mediates the association between vascular and glymphatic function. Astrocytic activation mediates the association between glymphatic function and clinical scales, whereas glymphatic function mediates the association between vascular function and clinical scales.

This study explored diagnostic experiences in Australia.\n\nMETHODS: This Joint Solutions sub-study employed a mixed-methods approach. Surveys and focus groups targeted people with YOD, caregivers, and clinicians across Australia. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and comparisons, while qualitative data underwent thematic analysis.\n\nRESULTS: There were 313 participants, mostly female and nearly half representing lived experience. The average age at symptom onset was 55.8 years, and at diagnosis, 57.9 years. Positive aspects included timely diagnoses and involvement of specialized clinicians. Clinicians emphasized comprehensive history-taking and a multifaceted diagnostic approach. Geographical barriers, variations in diagnosis delivery, and caregiver education needs were noted.\n\nDISCUSSION: This study highlights improved diagnostic timelines but ongoing barriers in YOD knowledge and equitable access to care. Raising awareness, improving clinician education, and streamlining referral processes are essential.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: Timeliness of younger-onset dementia diagnosis appears to have improved in Australia. Access to care varies in availability and quality, with no standardized pathways. Knowledge of younger-onset dementia is lacking in both healthcare and the community. Comprehensive history-taking and a multifaceted diagnostic approach are crucial. Clinician sensitivity is valued, balanced with tailored education on diagnosis.",

Nonetheless, our comprehension of the roles of its subunits, especially during the interictal phase, remains limited. This study investigated hypothalamic volumetric differences between individuals with episodic migraine and healthy controls, with scans conducted during the interictal phase, free from the effects of preventative medications.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed hypothalamic volumes in 30 patients with episodic migraine without aura (MO), scanned during interictal periods and not on preventative medication, and in 30 healthy controls (HCs) matched for age and sex. Volumetric segmentation was performed of both hypothalamic subunits (anterior-inferior, anterior-superior, posterior, tubular inferior, and tubular superior) and the entire hypothalamus using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with T1-weighted sequences. General linear models were employed to evaluate volumetric differences after controlling for age, sex, and total brain volume.\n\nRESULTS: The volumes of hypothalamic subunits and overall hypothalamus volumes exhibited no statistically significant differences between HCs and MO patients (p > 0.05). No associations were found between the clinical characteristics of MO and the total hypothalamic volume or its subunits.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the hypothalamus and its subregions do not exhibit detectable volumetric alterations during the interictal phase in patients with migraine without aura.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) has been linked to the immune system, but the role of immune-related genes in AD remains unclear.ObjectiveTo investigate the association between immune-related genes and AD risk systematically.MethodsWhole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 1516 AD patients and 2010 controls. Genetic analysis of 8260 immune-related genes was conducted using PLINK 1.9 for common variants (MAF ≥ 0.01) and SKAT-O test for rare variants (MAF < 0.01). Molecular docking and RNA-seq were used to investigate the effects of SAMD9 variants on protein function and their role in immune system and AD pathogenesis. In a subset of 184 AD patients and 118 controls, the relationship between polygenic risk scores (PRS) and plasma biomarkers was examined.ResultsSignificant associations were observed between common variants in APOE and ABCA7 and AD. Two rare missense variants in SAMD9 (F222L, I1389T) were suggestively linked to AD. Molecular docking and RNA-seq indicated that SAMD9 F222L is a loss-of-function variant, affecting immune-related pathways. A rare missense variant in HRH1 was associated with the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. PRS of immune-related genes correlated with AD biomarkers (NfL, ptau181, ptau217, ptau231, and GFAP).ConclusionsCommon variants in APOE and ABCA7, along with rare missense variants in SAMD9 and HRH1, are linked to AD. The SAMD9 F222L variant was associated with altered immune-related gene expression, suggesting a potential link to AD pathogenesis. Immune-related gene PRS correlates with AD biomarkers, highlighting the immune system's role in AD in the Chinese population.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the factors influencing SCD progression remain unclear. It is necessary to develop a model for predicting cognitive progression in SCD.\n\nMETHODS: 96 participants with SCD and 36 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled from the Chinese Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle study between January 1 and June 30, 2022. Of these, 70 completed approximately 12 months of follow-up visits. Clinical, cognitive assessment, and neuroimaging data were collected. Cox proportional-hazard regression models were used to investigate the risk factors and construct a nomogram.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to HCs, participants with SCD had higher Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores, indicating they had poorer sleep quality, and had higher cerebral blood flow (CBF) in bilateral hippocampus, thalamus, and left precuneus (all p < 0.05). Poorer sleep quality and left precuneus CBF were independently associated with SCD progression (all p < 0.05). The nomogram constructed with these factors achieved good discriminative ability, with an AUC of 0.785 (95% CI: 0.609-0.960) and a coherence index of 0.840 (95% CI: 0.733-0.948). The calibration curves showed significant agreement between the model and actual observations, and the decision curve analysis of the model showed clinical benefit.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A predictive model for SCD progression constructed based on risk factors including PSQI scores and left precuneus CBF showed good accuracy and discrimination ability, and it may provide valuable insights for early stage screening of AD.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) vary markedly in terms of non-motor symptoms (NMS) as the disease progresses. To improve PD management and clinical-trial assessment, we aimed to determine NMS endotypes in a cohort of patients with advanced PD.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted an ancillary cluster analysis of the 2013-2018 cohort (n = 722) of PREDISTIM. In this French multicenter interventional cohort, consecutive candidates for subthalamic deep brain stimulation undergo thorough assessment of motor symptoms (MS) and NMS at the inclusion visit. The NMS data are based on the MDS-UPDRS, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and several psychiatric scales: Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS). Cluster analysis with 17 NMS was conducted to identify groups with homogenous NMS profiles.\n\nRESULTS: Three distinct NMS clusters were identified. The largest had mild MS. The smallest had moderate MS and the most severe NMS, including cognitive and psychiatric dysfunction. The middle-large group had moderate MS and NMS but was distinguished by having the worst sleeping problems. The clusters did not differ in onset age or patient age and may be underpinned by disparate patterns of anatomical brain damage.\n\nCONCLUSION: The mainly-motor (Cluster 1), mainly non-motor (Cluster 3), and intermediate (Cluster 2) NMS endophenotypes must be replicated in an independent cohort but may help stratify patients for management (pharmacological, deep-brain stimulation, and non-pharmacological treatments) and inclusion and assessment in clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With accumulating evidence that motor manifestations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may emerge from AD pathology independent of other copathologies, we investigated the neural basis of motor dysfunction under the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) framework.\n\nMETHODS: This study included 125 patients with AD, excluding individuals with severe leukoaraiosis or comorbid Lewy body features beyond Parkinsonism. Associations of ATN burden with motor dysfunction were tested using multivariate regression models, followed by mediation analyses exploring the cognitive contribution to these associations.\n\nRESULTS: Tau burden in the prefrontal, sensorimotor, and parietal regions was associated with motor dysfunction independent of amyloid or neurodegeneration. The effect of parietal tau on motor function was fully mediated by visuospatial dysfunction, whereas prefrontal/sensorimotor tau exerted direct effects without cognitive mediation.\n\nDISCUSSION: Increased tau burden in the sensorimotor and frontoparietal association cortices may elicit motor dysfunction in AD through either cognition-dependent or cognition-independent mechanisms, with effects depending on the affected regions.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: Tau burden was intimately associated with motor symptoms independent of Aβ or atrophy. Tau in sensorimotor and frontoparietal association cortices may elicit motor symptoms. Prefrontal/sensorimotor tau exerted cognition-independent effects on motor symptoms. Parietal tau indirectly influenced motor symptoms through visuospatial dysfunction. Parietal tau-related motor dysfunction may be partly explained by apraxic features.",

        "Abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) is a novel technique to study the brain by measuring its mechanical properties, such as stiffness and viscosity. These properties may provide insights into how the microstructure of the brain changes due to a pathology, however the connection between these microstructural mechanisms and the measured biomechanical properties are still largely unknown. For this reason, the present exploratory study utilizes multidimensional diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MD-dMRI), apart from MRE, to extract microstructural parameters of the whole brain tissue for a small cohort of 12 Parkinson disease (PD) patients and 17 healthy controls. A combination of these methods provides valuable insights into subtle changes due to PD as it probes variables such as microscopic fractional anisotropy (μFA) combined with measures of shear stiffness. MRE and MD-dMRI quantities across the brain are compared between the two groups and analyzed. It was found that there were significant softening effects in the temporal and occipital lobes due to PD, associated with an increase in the mean diffusivity in those regions, whereas other microstructural properties remained largely unchanged. The mesencephalon, on the other hand, displays changes in the MD-dMRI parameters consistent with neuronal atrophy, however no softening of this region was detected. In most regions, stiffness is significantly reduced due to age, which is correlated with a decrease in μFA and increase in MD. We hypothesize that age effects can mostly explain neuronal atrophy, whereas softening due to PD effects involve additional mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a progressive decline in neuronal function, posing a major challenge to understanding their molecular mechanisms. The role of DNA methylation in these diseases remains an area of research focus.\n\nMETHODS: A bibliometric analysis was performed using the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database, covering 3284 publications from January 1, 2000 to November 18, 2024. The search focused on articles related to methylation in neurodegenerative diseases, with queries limited to the \"title\" field. Only original articles and reviews in English were included. Data were analyzed using VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Bibliometrix R packages to visualize trends, identify collaborative networks, and identify key topics, such as DNA methylation and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nRESULTS: The analysis showed a steady increase in research output, with major contributions coming from the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. The University of California system, Harvard University, and University College London were leading institutions. Key journals such as the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, Nature, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences were identified as having impact. Keyword analysis highlighted DNA methylation and Alzheimer's disease as prominent research topics.\n\nCONCLUSION: Despite limitations such as the lack of experimental validation and clinical evidence, this study highlights the growing interest in methylation research on neurodegenerative diseases and underscores the need for innovative efforts to identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), characterized by abnormal movements during REM sleep, is a prodromal stage of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD). While iRBD shows emerging brain changes, their impact on structural connectivity and network efficiency, and their predictive value, remain poorly characterized.\n\nMETHODS: In this international prospective study, 198 polysomnography-confirmed iRBD patients and 174 controls underwent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and were analyzed. Cutting-edge diffusion tractography and network-based statistics were applied to reconstruct individual connectomes and assess network properties predicting DLB or PD.\n\nRESULTS: Structural architecture was already disrupted in iRBD, with both reduced and compensatory increased connections. Global efficiency was decreased. Local efficiency in motor regions was altered and associated with early clinical symptoms. Altered local efficiency in the supramarginal gyrus predicted DLB only.\n\nDISCUSSION: Early disruption of brain architecture in iRBD predicts progression to synucleinopathy-related dementia, offering a novel potential prognostic biomarker.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) patients show significant alterations in inter-regional structural connectivity. Global efficiency is reduced in iRBD compared to controls. Areas with increased local efficiency contribute to decreased global efficiency. Altered network efficiency is associated with emerging Parkinsonian features. Higher supramarginal efficiency predicts dementia with Lewy bodies in iRBD.",

        "Abstract": "The electrogenic sodium bicarbonate transporter 1 (NBCe1/Slc4a4), predominantly expressed in astrocytes, is important for brain pH regulation and homeostasis. Increased NBCe1 expression in reactive astrocytes has been associated with neuronal degeneration in ischemic stroke. However, the effects of astrocytic NBCe1 inhibition in stroke remain contradictory, and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we show that wild-type (WT) mice exhibited elevated NBCe1 expression in the peri-lesional regions at 3 days post-stroke. Astrocytic Nbce1 gene deletion in inducible Gfap-CreERT2+/-; Nbce1f/f mice (Nbce1iΔAstro) resulted in a significant reduction in NBCe1 mRNA and protein expression in astrocytes. Compared to WT stroke mice, Nbce1iΔAstro mice displayed reduced infarct volume, decreased brain swelling, improved cerebral blood flow, and accelerated neurological function recovery in the 1-5-day acute post-stroke period. Moreover, Nbce1iΔAstro stroke mice exhibited decreased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, accompanied by preserved perivascular AQP4 polarization, upregulation of Kir4.1 protein expression, and reduced astrocyte domain volume. Importantly, Nbce1iΔAstro stroke brains revealed an anti-inflammatory cytokine profiling signature, marked by increased TIMP-1 expression. Together, our findings suggest that astrocytic upregulation of pH regulatory protein NBCe1 after stroke contributes to increased BBB permeability, reactive astrogliosis, inflammation, and perivascular AQP4 dysregulation. Targeting astrocytic NBCe1 may represent a promising new therapeutic strategy to mitigate astroglial dysfunction in the post-stroke brain.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundAnxiety is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) and has previously been associated with changes in cortical thickness of various brain regions.ObjectiveTo identify changes in cortical thickness in PD-related anxiety.Methods148 patients from an ongoing cohort study were included: 30 PD patients with anxiety, 73 PD patients without anxiety and 45 healthy controls. Anxiety was measured with the Parkinson Anxiety Scale (PAS). A 7 T structural MRI scan was performed and used to compare cortical thickness between these groups. Region of interest (ROI) as well as whole-brain analyses were performed to identify differences.ResultsROI analyses revealed a strong negative association between the cortical thickness of the left lingual gyrus and the severity of anxiety in PD patients (R = -0.71; p = 0.006). Additional significant strong negative associations with the severity of anxiety in PD patients were observed in the frontal and cingulate regions (R between -0.56 and -0.65). Whole-brain analysis revealed a significant cluster of cortical thinning in the left anterior cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex weakly associated with PAS total score across all groups (R = -0.25, p = 0.00201).ConclusionsThis study is the first to report a strong negative association between left lingual gyrus thickness and anxiety severity in PD. Additionally, anxiety in early PD is associated with cortical thinning in the fronto-cingulate region, mainly affecting left sided structures. Future studies should examine whether these cortical changes can predict the anxiety progression patterns or the treatment response in PD patients.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe risk of unprovoked seizures in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is three-fold higher than the general population. However, no studies to date have reported on amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in patients with Alzheimer's disease with epilepsy (ADEP).ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to collect clinical and positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from ADEP patients to compare and present the clinical characteristics and Aβ deposition patterns in this patient population.MethodsFifteen patients with ADEP, thirty-five patients with AD, twenty-three with late-onset epilepsy (LOEP), and twelve healthy controls were recruited. PET/MRI detected intracranial Aβ deposition, and differences in the brain regions distribution were compared between groups at the region of interest and voxel levels. Demographic data and medical history were further collected, while clinical and cognitive assessments were performed.ResultsIn ADEP patients, the first seizure occurred in the early stages of AD, with focal-onset motor seizures accompanied by impaired consciousness being the predominant seizure type. Diagnosis and initiation of antiseizure medication (ASMs) were significantly delayed compared to LOEP patients. Additionally, the ADEP group showed less Aβ deposition in the middle cingulate gyrus than the AD group and had higher Mini-Mental State Exam and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores.ConclusionsThis study reveals the clinical features and brain imaging differences between AD patients with and without EP, preliminarily confirming that the spatial deposition pattern of Aβ may be related to epilepsy and ASMs.",

We recorded clinical data supported by a prospectively filled headache diary up to three one-year treatment cycles. The ITT analysis was performed with a multivariate linear mixed model considering the entire population.ResultsWe observed a marked and consistent reduction in monthly migraine days (MMDs) across the three one-year cycles of treatment: -12.7 )[-11.4 - -14.1] at end of the first year of treatment (C1), -12.4 [-11.0 - -13.8] at the end of the second year (C2) and -12.9 [-11.4 - -14.3] at the end of the third year (C3). Baseline and residual MMDs progressively decreased across the three cycles (p = 0.008): from 21.1 [19.8-22.4] to 9.6 [8.3-11.0] in C1, from 19.0 [17.4-20.5] to 9.6 [8.1-11.1] in C2, and from 15.9 [14.3-17.5] to 8.5 [6.9-10.1] in C3. At the end of C3, the 50% response rate was 38.5% (69/179).ConclusionsIn our cohort, mAbs induced a meaningful and sustained reduction in MMDs across three consecutive one-year cycles of treatment. The ITT analysis revealed a remaining high burden of disease. While confirming mAbs effectiveness in migraine prevention, these findings underscore the need for more treatment approaches and for exploring other non-CGRP dependent pathways.",

Non-invasive neuromodulation can be employed in the prevention and/or acute treatment of migraine. Remote electrical neuromodulation (REN), a type of non-invasive neuromodulation, is an effective and safe at-home treatment for migraine. It stimulates peripheral nerves in the upper arm to trigger conditioned pain modulation.\n\nMETHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library for clinical trials and observational studies that assess the efficacy of REN in patients with migraine attacks. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.4.1 and Open Meta Analyst software.\n\nRESULTS: Our study included 12 studies with 9912 migraine patients. In the single-arm meta-analysis, 64% (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.65), and 22% (95% CI: 0.213 to 0.237) of patients experienced a reduction in pain and pain-free status at 2 h, respectively. Additionally, 59% (95% CI: 0.548 to 0.637), and 54% (95% CI: 0.471 to 0.609) of patients reported sustained pain relief and sustained pain-free status at 24 h, respectively. Marked functional improvement was achieved in 59% (95% CI: 0.577–0.607) of patients within 2 h post-treatment with REN, and 54.6% (95% CI: [0.519 to 0.574]) reported the disappearance of their most bothersome symptom (MBS). Device-related adverse events were reported in 0.4% (95% CI: 0.003 to 0.005) of patients. In double arm meta-analysis, pain-free status at 2 h had an odds ratio (OR) of 2.77 (95% CI: 1.63 to 4.71).

        "Abstract": "The landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) diagnosis is evolving rapidly, driven by advances in disease understanding, biomarker tools, and disease-modifying therapies. Modern diagnostic approaches emphasize biological precision, early detection, and dynamic frameworks that adapt to treatment-induced changes in disease biology. These frameworks enable opportunities for personalized interventions-encompassing pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies-and for enhanced clinical trial design. However, implementing these advancements globally is influenced by diverse cultural, infrastructural, and regulatory factors. The 2024 Alzheimer's Association International Conference Advancements: Modernizing Diagnosis, held in Japan, provided a unique platform to explore these global dynamics, particularly from an Asian perspective.

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuronal degeneration and pathological α-synuclein accumulation. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central feature in PD pathogenesis, contributing to impaired bioenergetics, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and defective organelle communication. This review synthesizes the current understanding of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, including fission, fusion, mitophagy, and biogenesis, and their disruption in PD. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of intercellular mitochondrial transfer as a compensatory mechanism. Emerging evidence suggests that mitochondria can be transferred between neurons and glial cells through tunneling nanotubes, extracellular vesicles, and gap junctions, offering protective effects by restoring metabolic function and attenuating cellular stress. We examine the molecular mediators of these transfer pathways, the influence of PD-associated mutations, and the bidirectional dynamics between donor and recipient cells. Additionally, we explore translational strategies, including mitochondrial transplantation, bioengineered mitochondria, and stem cell-based delivery systems. While preclinical models demonstrate promising therapeutic outcomes, clinical translation faces challenges, including targeting specificity, mitochondrial viability, and immune compatibility. By integrating mechanistic insights with therapeutic developments, this review highlights mitochondrial transfer as a novel and promising approach in the future treatment of PD, potentially addressing longstanding limitations in conventional neuroprotective strategies.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundWe demonstrated that Honokiol (HKL), a natural compound from Magnolia officinalis, exerts neuroprotection in APP/PS1 mice by increasing the expression of Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), which activates mitochondrial autophagy. We also found that the liver may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether HKL exerts its protection on AD through hepatic pathways.ObjectiveWe aimed to elucidate the impact of HKL on the liver of AD mice and its mechanisms.MethodsAPP/PS1 transgenic mice were utilized as AD models and administered with HKL and 3-TYP (an inhibitor of SIRT3). Congo-red staining and immunohistochemistry were conducted to detect the Aβ1-42 plaque deposition in the brain. Hematoxylin-eosin and Oil red O staining were employed to observe alterations in hepatic morphology. Liver function markers were tested to assess the metabolic function. qRT-PCR was employed to examine the level of SIRT3 mRNA. Western blot was performed to evaluate the expression of SIRT3, insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), GpLD1, lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP-1), ANGPTL8, and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2).ResultsHKL mitigated the Aβ1-42 plaque deposition in the brains of AD mice. It also reduced hepatic morphological damage. Additionally, HKL decreased the levels of ALT, AST, ALP, TBIL, and DBIL, and enhanced the levels of TP and ALB. It increased the levels of SIRT3 mRNA, and also the expression of SIRT3, IDE, GpLD1, and SOD2, while suppressing the expression of LRP-1 and ANGPTL8. 3-TYP could reverse all these effects of HKL on AD mice.ConclusionsHKL might alleviate liver damage of AD mice by upregulating SIRT3.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Iron and myelin alterations contribute to the progression of Parkinson disease (PD). This study aimed to evaluate the associations of iron-related positive susceptibility and myelin-related negative susceptibility with motor and cognitive functions, and assess their utility in classifying PD with normal cognition (PD-CN) and with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI).\n\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 59 patients with PD-MCI and 58 with PD-CN. Magnetic susceptibility values were extracted using magnetic susceptibility source separation. Correlations of motor and cognitive functions with susceptibility values were evaluated, and classification models were developed to distinguish PD-MCI from PD-CN.\n\nRESULTS: Positive susceptibility correlated with Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III off-state scores in the right internal globus pallidus and substantia nigra (r = 0.750 [95 % CI: 0.659 to 0.830], 0.758 [95 % CI: 0.681 to 0.822]) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores in the right caudate nucleus (r = -0.644 [95 % CI: -0.742 to -0.521]). Negative susceptibility correlated with MDS-UPDRS part III off-state scores in the bilateral external globus pallidus (right: r = 0.299 [95 % CI: 0.091 to 0.453], left: r = 0.285 [95 % CI: 0.112 to 0.444]). The positive susceptibility model achieved a sensitivity of 0.780 (95 % CI: 0.776 to 0.782), specificity of 0.793 (95 % CI: 0.790 to 0.796), and an ROC AUC of 0.856 (95 % CI: 0.855 to 0.859).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Positive and negative susceptibility values were associated with motor and cognitive function in PD and proved effective in differentiating PD-MCI from PD-CN.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a complex and unmet medical challenge, requiring innovative approaches to address its multifaceted pathology. In this study, we explored chromeno[3,4-b]xanthones as a novel multifunctional scaffold, synthesized via the straightforward cyclization of their precursor, (E)-2-styrylchromones. Compounds 10 and 11q-s exhibited potent and selective cholinesterase inhibition (IC50 1.7-9.0 μM for AChE and BChE), along with significant antiamyloid activity (inhibition exceeding 50% at 50 μM). Among them, compound 11r demonstrated the most well-balanced multifunctional profile against all four AD-relevant targets. Molecular docking studies revealed key π-stacking, hydrogen bonding, and halogen interactions, which underlie the selective binding of compound 11r to AChE and BChE. Moreover, docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that compound 11r binds strongly to the L-S-shaped β-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ42) fibril with a binding affinity of -11.3 kcal/mol, representing a structural barrier to Aβ42 elongation. Additionally, compound 11r, selected as the representative scaffold, effectively disrupted Aβ aggregation, as demonstrated by in vitro studies, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and cellular studies. It also displayed favorable drug-like properties, including predicted blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and an acceptable safety profile at active doses. The calcein-AM-assay also showed that this compound is unlikely to be actively effluxed from the brain. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of chromeno[3,4-b]xanthone as multifunctional agents for AD, broadening the chemical space of small-molecule exploration.",

Temporal trends were quantified via estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), and future trajectories were projected using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.ResultsBetween 1990 and 2021, global smoking-attributable ADOD deaths and DALYs increased by 108.85% (67,176 deaths) and 92.88% (1.53 million DALYs), respectively. However, age-standardized rates declined significantly: ASMR decreased by 22.22% (EAPC = -0.95, 95% CI: -0.99, -0.91) and ASDR by 21.30% (EAPC = -0.88, 95% CI: -0.92, -0.83). Men exhibited higher baseline rates, but women experienced steeper declines (ASMR EAPC: -1.60vs-0.79). Elderly populations disproportionately bore the highest burden, especially those ≥65 years. The middle-SDI region bore the heaviest burden (47,038,000 DALYs), while East Asia accounted for 38% of deaths. Projections suggest that the burden of smoking-related ADOD may continue to rise by 2036.ConclusionsThe burden of smoking-related ADODs remains high, with marked disparities across age, gender and socioeconomic strata.

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease with largely unknown etiology. Evaluating the association between a healthy lifestyle with PD and genetic risk is necessary.\n\nMETHODS: The study included 438,241 participants from UK Biobank, with lifestyle information collected via baseline questionnaires. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were divided into quartiles. The healthy lifestyle, including alcohol consumption, BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, sedentary time, social connections, and diet, was categorized into favorable (scoring 6-7), intermediate (scoring 4-5), and unfavorable (scoring≤3) lifestyles.\n\nRESULTS: During an average follow-up of 9.34 years, 2,996 cases were diagnosed with PD. Compared to participants with an unfavorable lifestyle, those with a favorable lifestyle had a significantly lower risk (HR 0.862, 95% CI 0.753-0.986). Regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and appropriate social connection were protective factors for the risk of PD (HR 0.839, 95% CI 0.779-0.905; HR 0.921, 95% CI 0.851- 0.997; HR 0.790, 95% CI 0.698-0.893). Subgroup analysis by PRS showed that adhering to a healthy lifestyle reduced the risk of PD in all subgroups except the low genetic risk (HR 0.673, 95% CI 0.510-0.889; HR 0.774, 95% CI 0.611-0.982; HR 0.769, 95% CI 0.633-0.935). There was an interaction between high genetic risk and lifestyle scores and sleep duration (P=0.015 and P=0.024, respectively), also between sex and sedentary time (P=0.002).\n\nCONCLUSION: A healthy lifestyle was associated with a lower risk of PD, and it's important to identify the effect of genetic risk and sex on PD significantly influenced by lifestyle.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals with mild anomia often have difficulty finding words during conversations, even when they get normal results on standard language evaluations. The high frequency and familiarity of target objects may lead to the insensitivity of some naming assessments, complicating diagnosis. This study aims to adapt the Test de dénomination de Québec-30 images (TDQ-30) into Turkish, develop normative data adapted to the Turkish population, and determine its validity in Turkish-speaking patients.\n\nMETHODS: Data were collected from a total of 464 participants (414 healthy controls, 25 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 25 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Detection Test for Language Impairments in Adults and the Aged-Turkish version (DTLA-Tr), and Test de dénomination de Québec-30-Turkish version (TDQ-30 Tr).\n\nRESULTS: In Study 1, TDQ-30 was translated into Turkish and checked for cultural appropriateness for the Turkish community. In study 2, the adapted version, TDQ-30 tr, was applied to 414 healthy adults and elderly individuals to establish normative data for the test. In study 3, the analyses made known the validity of TDQ-30 Tr, and it was found that TDQ-30 can differentiate between healthy participants and those with AD and MCI, with healthy participants showing better results.\n\nCONCLUSION: In summary, the TDQ-30 Tr is an effective and dependable tool for identifying mild anomia associated with neurological impairments in Turkish-speaking adults and the elderly. Its ease of use makes it a vital instrument for improving evaluation tools in research and clinical settings in Turkey.",

        "Abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, whether its alteration precedes neuroinflammation and central synucleinopathy or results from these conditions is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore how alterations in BBB permeability may relate to disruptions in functional connectivity (FC) across cortical networks using HD-EEG and combining a network-based approach with Machine Learning (ML). This study involved 68 early-stage PD patients and 62 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Albumin Index (Qalb), obtained by albumin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) divided by the amount in the plasma, was assessed in all PD patients. EEG data were recorded with a 64-channel EEG system. Source reconstruction based on personal MRI was used to identify brain activity. Cortico-cortical FC was analyzed based on the weighted phase-lag index (wPLI) in θ-α-β-low γ bands. Network-based statistic (NBS) was used to compare FC between HCs and PD and to study the relationship between FC and BBB permeability, as measured by Qalb. PD patients exhibited a hypoconnected network at α bands and a hyperconnected network at β band compared to HCs. We observed a negative relation between Qalb and α-FC (network t = 3.6, p = 0.008). Regions with higher degrees were part of the prefrontal, limbic, and temporal lobes. No significant correlations between Qalb and clinical features or neurodegenerative markers were found. Increased BBB permeability in early-stage PD is associated with frequency- and region-specific abnormal cortical FC, supporting the hypothesis that alteration of BBB may accelerate PD pathology, contributing to a more malignant disease phenotype.",

No prior study has compared multiple validated dementia risk tools for predicting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) across multiple datasets. We assess the performance of the CogDrisk, ANU-ADRI, CAIDE, and LIBRA in predicting MCI.\n\nMETHOD: Data were obtained from the ARIC, Whitehall II, and PATH Through Life cohorts. Participants without dementia or MCI at baseline were included. Risk scores were computed using available risk factors and analysed using logistic regression, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) estimates. Multiple imputation was used to evaluate the impact of missing data.\n\nRESULTS: The ARIC (n = 5778), Whitehall II (n = 6387), and PATH (n = 2115) cohorts had mean baseline ages of 51.9, 55.8, and 62.5 years, with follow-ups of 28.2, 15.7, and 11.2 years, respectively. AUCs for MCI prediction were generally similar across tools and datasets. Dementia prevalence following MCI was highest in ARIC (23.6%), followed by Whitehall II (14.1%) and PATH (7.0%). In ARIC, CogDrisk showed slightly better AUCs for predicting MCI cases that progressed to dementia. Whitehall II and PATH showed mixed results, with wider confidence intervals for progressing MCI cases, and higher AUCs for non-progressing MCI cases using CogDrisk and ANU-ADRI. All tools performed consistently when predicting dementia without prior MCI.\n\nDISCUSSION: Dementia risk scores demonstrated comparable performance of MCI prediction and are more sensitive for identifying cases that progress to dementia, supporting their greater utility for informing risk reduction strategies.",

While previous studies indicate a potential link between these outcomes, little work has systematically evaluated these relationships, particularly in people with MS. The goal of this study was to assess the association between reactive balance and affect in people with MS, and whether fall-status moderates this relationship.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES: Reactive balance, affect, and fall status were collected cross-sectionally in 109 people with MS. Reactive balance length and latency (in forward and backward directions) were related to Activities of Balance Confidence (ABC) and the Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I; both continuous and dichotomous preparations) via linear models with and without retrospective fall status as a co-variate.\n\nRESULTS: We observed significant relationships between reactive stepping and affect. Relationships were more pronounced in backward losses of balance (rather than forward), and in temporal (step latency) rather than spatial (step length) outcomes. Finally, fall status moderated the reactive balance-affect relationship, such that people with MS and a fall history had a stronger and steeper relationship to affect than those without a fall history.\n\nDISCUSSION: These data support a link between concerns of falling and reactive balance responses, both closely related to fall-risk. This information improves our understanding of maladaptive behaviors leading to falls, which may facilitate identification of targets to reduce falls and their sequelae.",

The α -Synuclein Origin site and Connectome (SOC) model proposes body-first and brain-first subtypes, based on the origin and spread of α -synuclein pathology, with distinct clinical phenotypes. To evaluate the temporal profile of onset of the NMS in relation to the motor symptoms in patients with PD. Additionally, motor and non-motor differences based on the SOC model subtyping were evaluated. Interim data of 400 patients with PD was analysed from a prospective study. Motor symptoms and NMS were assessed using the MDS-UPDRS and MDS-NMS. Patients were classified based on their onset of NMS as pre-motor, concurrent with motor onset, or post-motor. Patients were also subtyped as body-first (RBD: pre-motor + at-motor onset) or brain-first (RBD: post-motor onset/no RBD). All patients had at least one NMS. Pain (63%), sleep disturbances (61.75%), and anxiety (55.3%) were most prevalent. About 26.5% experienced pre-motor NMS; however, pre-motor hyposmia and constipation had a lower prevalence than expected. Body-first patients (9.5%) had significantly more cognitive decline, autonomic symptoms, while brain-first patients had higher motor severity, LEDD, pain, and PIGD phenotype. Temporal mapping of NMS revealed distinct patterns of symptom chronology and pathogenesis of these symptoms. The observed dichotomy in the brain-first and body-first subtypes partially supports the conceptual framework of the SOC dual-pathway model. Further exploration, particularly longitudinal evolution may offer further insights into the pathogenesis of NMS in PD.",

To assess longitudinal variations mostly in monthly migraine/headache days (MMD/MHD) and other efficacy variables, patients were interviewed at baseline (T0), at month 3 (T1), month 24 (T2), treatment pause period (T3), and at month 3 after fremanezumab re-initiation (T4). The primary objective was to assess the ≥ 50% and ≥ 75% response rates at T4, compared to T3 and T2.\n\nRESULTS: Migraine relapsed in previous responders at T3, while fremanezumab re-initiation was not equally effective, as evidenced by lower ≥ 50% response rates, mostly in CM. At T4, 6 (9.7%) previously responsive HFEM patients and 27 (31%) previously responsive CM patients failed to obtain ≥ 50% MMD/MHD reduction, compared to T3. The rate of both HFEM and CM super-responders, obtaining a ≥ 75% response at T3, also dropped at T4.\n\nCONCLUSION: Discontinuation of fremanezumab after month 24 leads to rising MMD/MHDs. After fremanezumab re-initiation, a relatively reduced effectiveness in the first 3 months might occur, compared with the pre-fremanezumab cessation. Overall, our findings doubt the rationale behind mandated anti-CGRP treatment pauses in migraine prophylaxis.",

This study aimed to evaluate the predictive efficacy of SN+ for 8-year PD risk and its subtype-specific differences in ET/UT populations.\n\nMETHODS: 180 patients with tremors who underwent TCS were enrolled and categorized based on the tremor type (ET/UT) and SN echogenicity grade (SN+/SN-). 127 patients (59 with ET, 68 with UT) completed a mean follow-up period of 8.01 years (range: 7.41-8.67; median: 7.92), during which new-onset PD was documented.\n\nRESULTS: In the ET cohort, 52.4% of SN+ individuals developed PD, compared to 7.9% in the SN- group. For UT, the PD incidence was 91.2% in SN+ individuals and 50.0% in SN- individuals. Multivariable-adjusted Firth logistic regression revealed significant associations between SN+ and PD in the ET and UT groups. Moreover, Bayesian logistic regression confirmed SN+ was significantly associated with PD risk in both groups. The posterior probability of an odds ratio exceeding 5 for SN+ was greater than 80% in both cohorts. Subgroup interaction analysis demonstrated no evidence of effect modification by tremor subtype, indicating consistent SN+ effects across cohorts.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: TCS-detected SN+ is a predictor of PD progression over 8 years in both ET and UT cohorts. The consistent risk association across tremor subtypes in SN+ subgroups supports its clinical potential as a cross-tremor subtype biomarker.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease causing motor fatiguability. The impact of MG on quality of life (QoL) is incompletely studied. Here, we explore the impact of disease activity on QoL.\n\nMETHODS: Using the Swedish nationwide MG registry, 150 MG cases with concomitant EQ-5D-3L and MG-ADL, QMG and/or MG-QoL-15 scores were identified. An EQ-5D score was derived from EQ-5D-3L using the UK time trade-off tariff and compared to a Swedish reference population. Longitudinal analysis assessing the impact of change in MG-ADL on QoL was performed on data from the randomized-controlled RINOMAX trial.\n\nRESULTS: EQ-5D score was negatively correlated with MG-ADL, QMG and MG-QoL-15 (R =  - 0.48, - 0.33, and - 0.66, respectively; p < 0.01). The usual activities dimension deviated most from reference population, although all dimensions were significantly impacted. Lower EQ-5D score was observed already at low-to-moderate disease activity, MG-ADL 3-5 points, compared to reference (0.71 [SD 0.23] vs. 0.81 [SD 0.04]; p = 0.01), and was further decreased with higher disease activity. Longitudinal analyses revealed a significant decrease of EQ-5D score per point increase in MG-ADL (β -0.050 [95%CI -0.077, -0.023]; p < 0.001). Most impact on EQ-5D score was observed by limb and respiratory items (limb β - 0.17 [95%CI - 0.26, - 0.071]; p = 0.001, respiratory β - 0.21 [95%CI - 0.39, - 0.031]; p = 0.022), while bulbar symptoms showed no effect on EQ-5D score.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We observed a considerably decreased EQ-5D score already at low disease activity in MG patients, worsening with increasing disease activity. This indicates an unmet medical need that warrants improved treatment and care.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by complex interactions between genetic risk factors and structural brain changes. Traditional diagnostic approaches that rely on single-modality data, such as imaging or genomics alone, often fall short in both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To address these limitations, AlzCLIP, a novel contrastive learning framework that integrates single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles and MRI-derived imaging features into a unified embedding space is introduced. This joint representation captures disease-relevant interactions between genetic variation and brain structure, enabling both accurate diagnosis and mechanistic insight into AD. AlzCLIP is trained and evaluated on two large-scale cohorts, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the UK Biobank (UKB), and demonstrated robust diagnostic performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up to 19%. More importantly, the model yields interpretable outputs through feature importance and interaction analyses, identifying key contributors to AD risk, including rs1135173, rs7575209, and rs66763080, as well as structural markers such as hippocampal volume and precuneus surface area. Notably, AlzCLIP uncovered genotype-specific effects on imaging phenotypes. Specifically, rs11077054 is associated with increased white matter hyperintensity burden and amygdala atrophy, suggesting a potential link between this variant and AD-related structural brain changes. Together, the results highlight AlzCLIP's potential to enhance AD risk prediction and provide biologically grounded insights by integrating multi-modal genomic and imaging data.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundMitochondrial dysfunction, particularly complex I (CI) deficiency, is considered an integral feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, recent findings indicate that widespread neuronal CI deficiency in the brain is only present in a subpopulation of 20-30% of cases. This stratification may be relevant for selecting participants for clinical trials, emphasizing the need for clinically applicable biomarkers. We previously reported CI deficiency in skeletal muscle biopsies of a subpopulation of persons with PD (PwPs), suggesting potential for mitochondrial stratification using extra-neural tissues. Platelets are another tissue previously reported to exhibit mitochondrial respiratory defects in PD. However, studies have generally involved small sample sizes and reported variable results.ObjectiveTo determine whether platelets exhibit impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activity in PwPs, or in a subpopulation of PwPs.MethodsUsing spectrophotometric activity assays, we assessed CI and complex IV (CIV) activities in platelet samples from 61 PwPs and 31 neurologically healthy controls from a well-characterized prospective cohort. The correlation between activities measured in platelets and skeletal muscle was also explored in 51 of the same individuals.ResultsPlatelet CI and CIV activities showed no difference between PwPs and controls at the group level, nor evidence of a subgroup with deficiency of either complex. There was no correlation between complex activities in platelet samples and skeletal muscle biopsies from the same individuals.ConclusionsBased on these results, we propose that platelet CI or CIV activities are not sensitive markers of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents significant therapeutic challenges due to its multifactorial pathology, the inefficacy of traditional single-target drugs, and the poor bioavailability and limited blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of promising multi-target phytochemicals like curcumin, resveratrol, and quercetin. This review systematically examines the rational design and recent advancements in engineered nanoplatforms for brain-targeted co-delivery of phytochemicals in AD. Nanotechnology leverages lipid-based systems (liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles), polymer-based carriers (PLGA nanoparticles), inorganic nanosystems (gold, selenium nanoparticles), and biologically-derived vehicles to significantly enhance phytochemical stability, targeting efficiency, and brain accumulation. Strategic surface functionalization with BBB-translocating ligands, including transferrin receptor antibodies and RVG29 peptide, combined with stimuli-responsive mechanisms exploiting the pathological microenvironment (pH, enzyme sensitivity), enables efficient BBB penetration and lesion-specific drug release. These nanodrug delivery systems demonstrate substantial cognitive improvement in AD animal models through synergistic multi-pathway effects: inhibiting Aβ aggregation, modulating Tau phosphorylation, reducing neuroinflammation, and enhancing antioxidant activity, often at markedly reduced doses compared to free drugs. While preclinical results are compelling, critical challenges remain in nanocarrier long-term biosafety, scalable manufacturing, and clinical translation. This review provides a comprehensive framework and technical insights for developing efficient, safe, and translatable nanotherapeutics for AD.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests significant associations between Parkinson's disease (PD) and cancer risks, with epidemiological studies revealing a complex relationship. PD patients exhibit lower risks of lung, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal cancers but higher risks of melanoma and brain cancers. Despite these observations, the underlying mechanisms between PD and cancers are poorly understood.\n\nOBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify molecular signatures underlying this complex connection by assessing transcriptional associations between PD-related genes, patient survival, and the cancer-specific co-expression networks in which these genes are involved.\n\nMETHODS: To explore this, we analyzed transcriptomic data from 18 cancer types in the TCGA dataset (n = 6088) and 16 cancer types in the DepMap dataset (n = 682). We focused on seven genes causally implicated in PD (SNCA, PINK1, LRRK2, PRKN/PARK2, PARK7, GBA1, and ATP13A2) and conducted in silico analyses, to evaluate their associations with survival and correlation with genes, pathways, and response to drugs in the context of cancer.\n\nRESULTS: Our findings revealed that the expression levels of the genes correlated with overall survival in a cancer-specific manner, often influenced by the TP53 genetic status. These genes were also associated with key cancer hallmarks such as genomic instability and cell proliferation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that PD and cancer may be connected through shared biological pathways, some overlapping with cancer hallmarks, and highlights the need for future mechanistic and functional studies to clarify the role of PD genes in cancer biology. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

We investigate whether dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), which captures time-varying neural interactions, can reveal sex-specific brain network disruptions in AD that conventional static connectivity analyses may miss.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed dFC in the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) dataset across three diagnostic groups (normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, dementia), stratified by sex, and regressed out age. We evaluated group differences using multiple distance metrics sensitive to various aspects of network structure, with statistical significance assessed via permutation testing.\n\nRESULTS: Distinct sex-specific patterns emerged across diagnostic groups, with each metric sensitive to different aspects of network disruption. Peak connectivity states, rather than mean levels, more effectively reflected brain network dynamics.\n\nDISCUSSION: By emphasizing network dynamics, our findings highlight promising signatures for early detection and longitudinal biomarkers. Future work will explore metrics tailored to specific demographic or clinical subpopulations.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: Dynamic connectivity reveals sex-specific brain disruptions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Peak-based analysis improves sensitivity over mean-based connectivity measures. Topological and geometric metrics capture distinct network disruptions by sex. Mild cognitive impairment shows less consistent connectivity changes due to diagnostic instability.

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The joint effect of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) health and genetic susceptibility on dementia remains unclear.\n\nMETHODS: This prospective cohort study utilized data from the UK Biobank. CKM syndrome was characterized by the presence of metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. We employed Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between CKM syndrome and dementia incidence, while also investigating the influence of genetic risk via polygenic risk score (PRS) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status. We also examined the association between CKM syndrome and cognitive function via linear regression model.\n\nRESULTS: Among 331,731 participants (mean ± SD age, 56.53 ± 8.1 years; 156,762 [47.26 %] male), 4413 (1.33 %) developed dementia during a mean follow-up of 12.8 years. Advanced CKM syndrome correlated with higher risk of dementia; compared to stage 0, HRs for dementia were 1.19 (95 % CI 1.01-1.39, P = 0.036), 1.26 (95 % CI 1.09-1.45, P = 0.002), and 2.06 (95 % CI 1.77-2.39, P < 0.001) for stages 1, 2, and 3-4, respectively. Genetic susceptibility further strengthened this association, and the synergistic effect of CKM syndrome, dementia PRS, and APOE ε4 status surpasses the individual contributions of any single factor. These findings remained robust in a series of subgroups and sensitivity analyses. Individuals in the later stages of CKM syndrome demonstrated poorer performance on cognitive function tests.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Poor CKM health was independently associated with cognitive impairment and an increased risk of dementia. The association between CKM syndrome and risk of dementia could be further strengthened by genetic susceptibility.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The genetic etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is complex; approximately 10% of patients with PD have various gene mutations that lead to familial forms of the disease. Recent analyses of non-coding repeat regions revealed that many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with pathological expansions. We evaluated the genetic background of non-coding repeat expansions in Japanese patients with PD.\n\nMETHODS: We collected blood samples from 203 Japanese patients with PD and analyzed various non-coding repeat genes, including ATXN8OS, RFC1, C9ORF72, NOTCH2NLC, BEAN1/TK2, and NOP56, using PCR-Sanger sequencing, repeat-primed PCR assay, and long-read sequencing.\n\nRESULTS: Three patients with PD (1.5%) were found to have heterozygous repeat expansions in ATXN8OS, the gene causative of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 and is associated with long non-coding RNA. One (0.5%) patient had compound heterozygous repeat expansions (AAGGG and ACAGG) in RFC1, the gene causative of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome, which encodes a DNA repair protein. No patient had repeat expansions in C9ORF72, NOTCH2NLC, BEAN1/TK2, or NOP56. All patients with ATXN8OS repeat expansions exhibited typical parkinsonism with relatively rare subjective dysphagia, which was confirmed by videofluoroscopic results. Functional imaging, such as dopamine-transporter single photon emission computed tomography, showed abnormal findings in patients with non-coding repeat expansions.\n\nDISCUSSION: Our findings revealed the importance of non-coding repeat expansions in Japanese patients with PD. This is the first study to show the positive result of non-coding repeat expansions in many patients with PD in Japan.",

General clinical information and laboratory test results were collected. WMH was interpreted on MRI, and periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) were scored, respectively. According to the score of Fazekas, WMH was divided into two groups. Factors influencing WMH severity were analyzed, and the relationship between SUA and WMH was further explored. The results showed that the SUA of patients with moderate to severe DWMH was higher than that of patients with no or mild DWMH (345.10 ± 97.52 μmol/L vs. 317.99 ± 91.21 μmol/L, p = 0.028). There was no significant difference in SUA between the moderate to severe PVH group and the no or mild PVH group (336.49 ± 99.29 μmol/L vs. 319.16 ± 89.92 μmol/L, p = 0.131). Spearman correlation analysis showed that SUA was positively correlated with the severity of DWMH (r = 0.123, p = 0.037), while SUA was not significantly correlated with PVH severity (r = 0.070, p = 0.234). After adjusting for confounders by multifactor logistic regression, SUA was independently correlated with DWMH severity (OR: 1.005, 95% CI: 1.002-1.009, p = 0.004). There was no significant correlation between SUA and PVH (OR: 1.003, 95% CI: 1.000-1.006, p = 0.051).\n\nCONCLUSION: SUA is an independent risk factor for DWMH in patients, and there is no significant correlation between SUA level and PVH.",

VM was more common in women (72% vs. 51%) and had an earlier onset (39.6 vs. 49.9 years). MD patients had more rotational vertigo, greater caloric asymmetry, and lower VOR gains on video head impulse testing (all p < 0.0001). The tree identified seven key variables and achieved 86% accuracy. Sixty-six VM patients were diagnosed as 'suspected VM' based on expert judgment. Discrepancies were primarily due to short attack duration and atypical symptoms.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study identified seven clinical variables to effectively distinguish VM from MD. While VM and MD share overlapping features, diagnostic ambiguity remains common, particularly in cases not meeting ICVD criteria. Our findings support the introduction of a 'suspected VM' category to capture patients with atypical presentations not covered by ICVD criteria.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons (DNs) in the substantia nigra (SN). PD neuropathology is mainly related to inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The underlying causes for the progression of PD are linked to the uncontrolled activation of different signaling pathways, such as the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is highly expressed in the nigrostriatal pathway. RAS has two main pathways: the classical pathway, which includes angiotensin I (AngI), AngII, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Ang type 1 receptor (AT1R), and Ang type 2 receptor (AT2R), that has a neuro-detrimental effect on PD neuropathology, and the nonclassical pathway, which includes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7), that has a neuroprotective effect against different neurological disorders, including PD. The nonclassical pathway is activated to overcome the harmful impact of the classical pathway on the brain, thereby converting AngII to angiotensin A (Ang-A) via mononuclear leukocyte-derived aspartate decarboxylase (MILDAD). Ang-A is further converted to the neuroprotective alamandine, which acts on the mass-related G-protein coupled receptor member D (MrgD). In PD, overactivation of the classical pathway is associated with neurodegeneration of the DNs in the SN. However, the nonclassical pathway, mainly Ang1-7/alamandine, is deregulated in PD. The objective of the review: This review aims to explore and discuss the potential role of the nonclassical RAS pathway in the pathogenesis and progression of PD and its implications for future therapeutic strategies.",

        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects both motor and non-motor functions, including autonomic regulation. In the cardiovascular system, autonomic dysfunction may result in blood pressure (BP) abnormalities, such as altered variability. Therefore, the present study aimed to test the hypothesis that patients with PD exhibit increased resting beat-to-beat blood pressure variability (BPV) compared to healthy controls.\n\nMETHODS: Beat-to-beat heart rate (via electrocardiography) and BP (via photoplethysmography) were continuously recorded in 19 patients with PD, 15 age-matched older adults, and 19 young adults. Cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were estimated using the ModelFlow method. BPV was assessed using several indices, including the standard deviation (SD) and average real variability (ARV).\n\nRESULTS: Compared to both older and younger control groups, patients with PD exhibited lower ARV values for systolic (1.6 ± 0.5 vs. 2.3 ± 0.5 and 3.1 ± 1.1 mm Hg, P = 0.001), diastolic (0.9 ± 0.2 vs. 1.1 ± 0.4 and 1.5 ± 0.6 mm Hg, P = 0.001), and mean (0.9 ± 0.2 vs. 1.2 ± 0.4 and 1.5 ± 0.5 mm Hg, P = 0.001) BP. In addition, patients with PD showed reduced ARV in TPR compared to the older control group (0.5 ± 0.2 vs. 0.7 ± 0.7 mm Hg/L/min, P = 0.045). However, ARV in CO did not differ significantly between PD patients and older adults (119 ± 68 vs. 136 ± 48 mL/min, P = 0.806). Similar patterns were observed when using other BPV indices.\n\nCONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Parkinson's disease may lead to a reduction in beat-to-beat blood pressure variability, potentially driven by changes in total peripheral resistance rather than cardiac output.",

        "Abstract": "To evaluate the performance of an MR-guided PET reconstruction method in enhancing the image quality of brain PET images acquired with an integrated PET/MR system. We implemented an MR-guided PET reconstruction (MRg) algorithm in an integrated PET/MR system and conducted both phantom and clinical studies. The PET images of a Hoffman phantom were reconstructed using the MRg algorithm and routine Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (OSEM) algorithm. Image quality metrics were calculated to investigate the dose effects, number of iterations, and penalization factor (β). In the clinical study, the PET images of 30 patients without brain lesions, two patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 18 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and one patient with cavernous angioma were reconstructed using MRg and OSEM, respectively. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were performed. In the phantom study, MRg images demonstrated improved image quality metrics (higher contrast and lower variability) compared to conventional OSEM, particularly at lower doses. The penalization factor  β = 2 $$ \\beta =2 $$  maximized the advantages of MRg. In the clinical study of patients without brain lesions, MRg significantly outperformed OSEM in image quality evaluation. For patients with DLBCL, the lesions' signal/contrast-to-background/noise ratios exhibited significant improvements using the MRg. For patients with PD, the standardized uptake value ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of bilateral putamen were significantly improved by MRg. The MRg has convincingly demonstrated significant advantages over the conventional OSEM in brain PET images, indicating great potential in clinical routines for brain PET/MR examinations.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is known for causing cognitive decline and significant synaptic dysfunction, continues to pose a significant barrier to good health among the aging population worldwide. While there remain major knowledge gaps in the exact molecular framework of this complex and devastating disease, emerging evidence strongly implicates epigenetic dysregulation as having a major influence on the complexity of the various pathological processes, driving this debilitating disease. This comprehensive review meticulously delves into the critical and multifaceted role of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) as a key player in actively driving the various neurotoxic processes closely connected to AD's characteristic pathological hallmarks and features. We extensively point out the diverse interconnected pathways via which dysregulated HDAC2 activity contributes to the initiation and progression of multiple intricate mechanisms responsible for the observed synaptic dysfunction, the marked accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tau tangles. Furthermore, we explore the intricate interplay between the aberrant HDAC2 activity and resulting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress within the brain's microenvironment. Additionally, the review summarises the current developments towards HDAC inhibition, carefully identifying the existing limitations in this rapidly evolving field of research, and highlighting promising avenues and potential future directions for developing effective and demonstrably safe therapies. Finally, the approaches that can facilitate the selective modulation of this crucial epigenetic enzyme to combat the devastating effects of AD are suggested and elucidated.",

        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder causing acute inflammatory polyneuropathy, resulting in muscle weakness. Timely diagnosis is critical to prevent complications such as respiratory failure and long-term disability. Ultrasound imaging of peripheral nerves, specifically assessing nerve cross-sectional area (CSA), has been suggested as a diagnostic tool for GBS. This systematic review aims to evaluate the utility of nerve ultrasound in diagnosing and monitoring GBS.\n\nMETHODS: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, searching databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to December 2024. Studies that used ultrasound to assess peripheral nerve size in GBS patients compared to healthy controls or other neuropathy patients were included. Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4 software.\n\nRESULTS: Out of 848 studies, 25 met the inclusion criteria, with 12 included in the meta-analysis. A total of 528 patients with GBS were included. Ultrasound revealed significant increases in the CSA of cervical, peroneal, median, ulnar, and tibial nerves in GBS patients. Specifically, cervical nerve enlargement (MD: 1.45, P = 0.0008) and peroneal nerve enlargement (Mean Difference (MD): 2.09, P < 0.00001) were notable. Subgroup analysis revealed significant enlargement of the ulnar and tibial nerves across different anatomical regions.\n\nCONCLUSION: Ultrasound imaging of peripheral nerves, particularly changes in CSA, provides valuable diagnostic insight for GBS, may be helpful in early recognition and intervention. Further studies are needed to establish consistent CSA patterns and improve diagnostic accuracy across various GBS subtypes.",

        "Abstract": "The amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) biomarker framework has greatly progressed the diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, recent research highlights neuroinflammation as an equally critical factor in AD pathology across humans, rodents, and non-human primates (NHPs). This review evaluates the combined use of ATN and neuroinflammatory biomarkers-such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (astrocytic marker) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2)/ ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1) (microglial markers)-in elucidating AD mechanisms, promoting early diagnosis, and shaping therapeutic strategies. It also summarizes the key features and translational potential of NHP models that closely mimic human AD pathology, highlighting the promising prospects of integrating these models with the ATN(X) biomarker system. These insights strengthen the link between biomarkers, NHP research, and clinical practice, opening new avenues for the early detection and treatment strategies of AD. HIGHLIGHTS: Neuroinflammation biomarkers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2)/sTREM2, and YKL-40, show strong clinical potential in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Incorporating neuroinflammation biomarkers into the ATN(X) framework may enhance diagnostic precision. Advanced non-human primate (NHP) models closely replicate human brain pathology, addressing key limitations of mouse models. Measuring ATN(X) biomarkers in NHPs may improve clinical translation and support early diagnosis of AD. Optimizing NHP models-including ApoE4 status, injection protocols, and gene-editing approaches-is crucial for reproducibility and efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Memory impairment is a prevalent symptom in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), with working memory loss being the most prominent deficit. Recent experimental evidence suggests that abnormal calcium levels in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) may disrupt synaptic transmission, leading to memory loss in AD patients. However, the specific mechanisms by which intracellular calcium homeostasis influences memory formation, storage, and recall in the context of AD remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the effects of intracellular calcium homeostasis on AD-related working memory (WM) using a spiking network model. We quantify memory storage by measuring the similarity between images during the training and testing phases. The model results indicate that ~90% of memory can be stored in the WM network under normal conditions. In contrast, the presence of amyloid beta (Aβ), associated with AD, significantly reduces this similarity, allowing only 54%-58% of memory to be stored, this alteration trend is consistent with previous experimental findings. Further analysis reveals that downregulating the activation of inositol triphosphate (IP 3) receptors and upregulating the activation of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) pumps can enhance memory performance, achieving about 78% and 77%, respectively. Moreover, simultaneously manipulating both IP 3 and SERCA activations can increase memory capacity to around 81%. These findings suggest several potential therapeutic targets for addressing memory impairment in Aβ aggregation induced AD patients. Additionally, our network model could serve as a foundation for exploring further mechanisms that modulate memory dysfunction at the genetic, cellular, and network levels.",

Biomarkers such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL), and MRI-based hippocampal atrophy are potential indicators of neurodegeneration, but their long-term predictive value remains unclear.ObjectiveThis study examined 20-year longitudinal associations between CSF NfL, MRI-based hippocampal atrophy, and cognitive decline in cognitively normal older adults.MethodsA cohort of 279 cognitively normal adults aged ≥55 years was followed from 2003 to 2023 at the Knight ADRC. Participants underwent annual cognitive and neurological assessments, including Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), CSF NfL quantification, and MRI-based hippocampal volumetry. Cognitive decline was defined as: (1) first progression (CDR ≥ 0.5) and (2) sustained progression (two consecutive CDRs ≥ 0.5). Analyses included Kaplan-Meier survival, Cox proportional hazards models, and linear mixed-effects (LME) models.ResultsParticipants had a mean age of 66.5 years (SD = 6.08); 58.4% were female. Mean follow-up was 11.41 years (SD = 3.5). First progression occurred in 71 participants (25.4%), and sustained progression in 35 (13%). Higher CSF NfL levels were associated with faster time to first (95% CI:0.2-1; p < 0.001) and sustained progression (95% CI:0.46-1; p = 0.008). Cox models showed increased risk of first progression (HR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.11-3.01; p = 0.018) but not sustained (p = 0.093). LME models showed CSF NfL increase and hippocampal volume decline (p < 0.001) in both outcomes.ConclusionsCSF NfL is a strong predictor of cognitive decline and may serve as a screening biomarker for early dementia risk.",

        "Abstract": "The neuropeptides pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) play roles in vasodilation, the immune response and neuronal signaling, with recent links to headache disorders. This association has resulted in considerable interest in targeting this family of peptides and their receptors for drug development, and, notably, an anti-PACAP antibody has reported clinical efficacy in reducing migraine frequency. The PACAP/VIP ligands act at G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). PAC1, VPAC1 and VPAC2 are the officially-recognized canonical receptors. Each of these has the potential to generate receptor variants through exon splicing. These variants may exhibit altered function, significantly increasing the diversity of PACAP-responsive receptors. In addition to these canonical receptors, PACAP is proposed to activate other unrelated receptors, GPR55 and MRGPRX2. Altogether, any of these canonical and proposed receptors may mediate the biological actions of PACAP, including migraine-relevant behaviors. However, we have a limited understanding of how these receptors function, such as their capacity to activate downstream signaling, the cellular and subcellular location of that signaling, and whether accessory protein interactions may alter these responses, especially in migraine-relevant contexts. The complex nature of the PACAP/VIP system therefore provides not only numerous considerations for target design and validation, but also unique opportunities for \"designer\" drugs. This narrative review provides an overview of the complex PACAP/VIP system, exploring peptide, receptor and downstream signaling behaviors that may be potential targets for the treatment of headache disorders and beyond.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) can seriously complicate and worsen the clinical outcome of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Atrial fibrillation (AF), larger stroke volumes, and reperfusion therapy are associated with increased risk for HT in AIS. The aim of our research was to evaluate the combined prognostic value of the ASPECTS score, AF, and revascularization therapy in predicting HT in AIS patients.\n\nMETHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted. Demographic data, presence of AF, application of revascularization therapy, and baseline ASPECTS were recorded. The primary outcome was the occurrence of HT during hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify potential predictors. ROC analysis was performed to assess the prognostic value of the analyzed parameters for HT prediction.\n\nRESULTS: Data from 150 successive AIS patients was registered for the final analysis. The active group (with HT during hospitalization) included 55 patients. No significant differences in age, gender distribution, or time to admission between the HT and control groups, were recorded. Lower ASPECTS, presence of AF, and revascularization therapy were independently associated with an increased risk of HT (p = 0.001, p = 0.004, and p = 0.007, respectively). ROC analysis for combined use of ASPECTS, AF, and revascularization therapies showed good predictive performance, AUC 76.51% (95% CI: 68.16-84.86%).\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that ASPECTS score, AF, and revascularization therapy are important predictors of hemorrhagic transformation in AIS. These results support the use of a combined clinical-imaging approach for risk stratification of HT in acute ischemic stroke patients.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily characterised by parkinsonism due to nigro-striatal dopaminergic denervation. While therapeutic strategies have traditionally focused on compensating for dopaminergic deficit, growing evidence reveals an involvement of cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways in the pathogenesis of the motor and non-motor manifestations of the disease. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChIs) and memantine (glutamate receptor antagonist) in patients affected by PD without dementia on motor (gait, balance) and non-motor (cognitive, behavioural, sleep and autonomic) symptoms usually poorly responsive to levodopa.\n\nMETHODS: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. The search was performed on PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase databases for articles published between January 1996 and October 2024, using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results are presented narratively.\n\nRESULTS: 12 RCTs were included in this review, with 10 (774 patients) focusing on ChIs and 2 (65 patients) on memantine. Some studies highlighted the beneficial effects of ChI on mild cognitive impairment and suggested potential improvements in apathy and gait disturbances. However, the findings regarding the impact of ChI and memantine on other non-motor symptoms were inconsistent.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Available RCTs suggest that ChIs may have a valuable role in managing cognitive impairment, apathy and gait disorders in PD patients without dementia. However, due to the lack of strong evidence, a cautious and individualised approach is advisable when considering these treatments.Cite Now.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The long prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the link the disease has with metabolic factors suggest that metabolomics could help identify affected individuals at early stages.\n\nOBJECTIVE: The goal was to examine whether plasma metabolomic profiles could identify individuals in the prodromal and clinical phase of PD.\n\nMETHODS: We quantified and compared the plasma metabolomic profiles of 922 individuals with PD who provided blood samples at a median of 11 years before (n = 809) or 2 years after (n = 113) disease diagnosis to that of matched controls, all selected from three established cohort studies (Nurses' Health Study, Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and Cancer Prevention Study II). We used conditional logistic regression models and machine learning techniques to identify metabolites predicting prodromal and clinically manifest PD.\n\nRESULTS: Several metabolites, especially amino acids, acyl-carnitines, and other lipids were nominally associated with PD since the years leading to disease diagnosis. Metabolites proposed as biomarkers of foods or care products tended to be associated with a higher PD risk closer to disease diagnosis. Metabolites reflecting higher intake of coffee, smoking, and acetaminophen tended to be associated with a lower PD risk over the course of the disease. Metabolomic profiles in prodromal samples were unable to accurately predict future clinical PD.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Metabolic pathways related to the metabolism of amino acids and lipids may be involved in PD progression. Metabolomic differences may also result from behavioral changes and medical management, emphasizing the need to consider prodromal and clinical data in future studies. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Motor complications (MC), including fluctuations, represent a disabling milestone of Parkinson's disease (PD) course, although the underlying early pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. We therefore investigated whether the biological profile at PD onset, as defined through a panel of CSF biomarkers, may predispose to the development of MC.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a dual-center retrospective longitudinal study involving 131 de novo (DN) PD patients (newly diagnosed, untreated). At baseline, patients were evaluated by motor and non-motor scores, and the measurement of CSF total α-synuclein (α-syn), total and phosphorylated-181-tau (t-tau, p-tau), amyloid-β42 and amyloid-β40 (Aβ42, Aβ40) levels, p-tau/t-tau, Aβ42/Aβ40, and p-tau/Aβ42 ratios. According to the successive development of MC, patients were classified as \"with MC\" (wMC) or \"without MC\" (noMC). A control group of 107 controls was also collected. Variables were compared between groups, adjusting for main covariates; ROC and Cox analyses evaluated predictive values.\n\nRESULTS: The DN PD cohort was followed for 57 (± 18) months, with 38 (29%) patients developing MC. At baseline, DN patients showed lower CSF total α-syn and t-tau levels than controls. The wMC group had higher p-tau, p-tau/t-tau, and p-tau/Aβ42 ratios than noMC. The p-tau/t-tau ratio best predicted MC development; above the cutoff of 0.148, MC were 2.6 times more likely with 81% sensitivity and 61% specificity (AUC = 0.79).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Elevated CSF p-tau/t-tau ratio in DN PD patients predicts higher MC risk, supporting biomarker-based stratification for patients at onset. Our findings also highlight Alzheimer's co-pathology, especially tauopathy, as a key factor in shaping PD motor progression from early stages.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundThe cerebellum plays a crucial role in cognitive processing, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease (AD).ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the effect of cerebellar intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) in patients with AD.MethodsWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial in which patients were randomly allocated to receive either active-iTBS or sham-iTBS. The primary outcome was the change in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores from baseline to week 4. Secondary outcomes included evaluations of neurophysiological measures, brain network functions, and glymphatic clearance.ResultsFrom April 20 to June 25, 2024, 20 patients were analyzed. Compared with sham-iTBS, active-iTBS significantly improved cognition at week 4, indicated by reduced CDR-SB scores (mean changes: -0.60 versus 0.15; adjusted β: 0.73; 95% CI, 0.17-1.26). In the active-iTBS group compared with the sham-iTBS group, the power spectral density in electroencephalogram revealed global decreased in theta power (adjusted β, -0.014; 95% CI, -0.024-0.003) and increased beta power (adjusted β, 0.002; 95%CI, 0.000-0.005), the functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated enhanced the gradient values of default mode network activity along the principal gradient, and the structural magnetic resonance imaging indicated an improvement in glymphatic clearance (adjusted β, 0.097, 95% CI, 0.0381-0.1603).ConclusionsA four-week course of iTBS improved cognitive function in patients with AD, possibly via promoting the Beta frequency band power, enhancing brain network functionality, and facilitating glymphatic clearance.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06379100, April 14, 2024).",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor impairments such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Regular physical activity plays a key role in managing these symptoms, yet the COVID-19 pandemic imposed social isolation measures that significantly curtailed physical activity, potentially accelerating motor decline. This systematic review aimed to synthesize evidence on the impact of pandemic-related social isolation on motor symptom deterioration in individuals with PD. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022369245) and conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Systematic searches were performed in Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, using a combination of keywords and Boolean operators related to Parkinson's Disease and the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligible studies included those addressing individuals with PD, exposure to social isolation, and outcomes related to motor performance. Methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. From 1534 identified records, 34 studies met inclusion criteria: 23 cross-sectional, 7 prospective longitudinal, 3 retrospective longitudinal, and 1 qualitative study. Findings consistently indicated a reduction in physical activity and a consequent worsening of motor symptoms, such as tremors, bradykinesia, and postural instability, leading to impaired functional performance, increased fall risk, and gait disturbances. Most studies demonstrated moderate to high methodological quality. These results underscore the potential detrimental impact of prolonged isolation and highlight the importance of interventions that help preserve motor function in individuals with PD during periods of restricted mobility.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tremor dominant Parkinson's disease (TDPD) and postural instability and gait disturbance (PIGD) are clinically defined motor subtypes of PD with significant differences in clinical phenotype, prevalence of non-motor symptoms (NMS), rate of progression and underlying pathophysiology.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate white matter microstructural integrity in TDPD and PIGD motor subtypes of PD to ascertain subtype specific patterns of involvement.\n\nMETHODS: Data was analysed for 162 subjects - TDPD (n = 74), PIGD (n = 54) and HC (n = 34) who were prospectively recruited. All subjects underwent detailed clinical assessment including the MDS-UPDRS, MDS-NMS, and motor subtyping was based on the ratio of mean TD/PIGD score (≥ 1.15:TD, ≤ 0.90: PIGD) from the MDS-UPDRS. 3T multi-shell diffusion weighted imaging data was acquired and processed. Diffusion metrics of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were considered for tract based spatial statistics and evaluation of whole tract measures.\n\nRESULTS: The PIGD group exhibited widespread reductions in FA and increases in MD, RD, and AD in motor, associative, and limbic tracts, consistent across voxel-wise and tract-level analyses. TDPD showed limited alterations. White matter changes in PIGD correlated with higher motor and non-motor symptom severity, particularly involving corticospinal, fronto-occipital, and cingulum tracts.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The PIGD variant of PD has significantly widespread alterations involving diffusion metrics of numerous dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic tracts involved in distinct motor and non-motor symptoms. These may be the basis for the phenotypic variations and differences in severity observed between these motor subtypes.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common causes of dementia in elderly populations. A multifactorial and complex etiology has hindered the establishment of successful disease-modifying and retarding treatments. An important molecular target that has a close link with the disease's pathophysiology is glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β). GSK-3β is thought to be an important bridge between amyloid and tau pathologies, the two principle pathogenic hallmarks of the disease. In particular, its kinase activity is thought to be a contributing factor for initiating aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation toward neurodegenerative progression. To identify potential inhibitors for GSK-3β, a pharmacophore-based virtual screening was used on the VITAS-M Lab database, a large database of small molecules. A co-crystal ligand employed as the template allowed the screening of roughly 200,000 compounds. Compounds successfully screened were selected on the basis of the Phase screen score combining vector alignments, volume scores, and site matching parameters. Using a cutoff score of 1.7, 174 compounds were docked using the Glide tool for molecular docking to further identify potential high-affinity binding ligands. Finally, four chemicals with the best binding scores (cutoff Glide GScore values of - 8 kcal/mol) were identified. Among these, 3-(2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)-N-(4-sulfamoylphenyl) benzamide (VL-1) and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (VL-2) showed strong and stable binding interactions, as evidenced by molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). The results suggest that VL-1 and VL-2 may serve as promising lead compounds for GSK-3β-based anti-AD therapeutics. However, further in vivo mechanistic validation is warrantied to confirm their therapeutic applicability.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the rs10191329 risk allele in the DYSF-ZNF638 locus, which is implicated in central nervous system resilience rather than immune-mediated pathology, is associated with retinal layer thinning, a biomarker of neuroaxonal damage in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS).\n\nMETHODS: From a prospective observational study, we included RMS patients with ≥ 2 optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, excluding eyes with optic neuritis during the observation period. DNA samples were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array-24 and variants imputed using the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel and Minimac4. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the association between rs10191329 risk allele number (rs10191329*A) and annualized rates of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (aLpRNFL) and macular ganglion-cell-and-inner-plexiform-layer (aLGCIPL) atrophy, adjusting for age, sex, MS-specific variables, and 10 ancestry components.\n\nRESULTS: We included 183 RMS patients (mean age 35.9 years [SD 9.6], 74.9% female, median EDSS 2.0 [range 0-6.5], median observation 25 months [12-73], median OCT scans 3 [2-5]). Multivariable analyses revealed that each rs10191329*A allele was associated with a 0.10%/year increase in aLpRNFL (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05-0.19, p < 0.001) and a 0.11%/year increase in aLGCIPL (95% CI 0.07-0.19, p < 0.001). The rs10191329 variant explained 8.9% of GCIPL atrophy and 8.2% of pRNFL atrophy variance.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Carriers of the rs10191329 risk allele show accelerated retinal atrophy, suggesting heightened neuroaxonal vulnerability in MS. While clinical implications are currently unclear, genetic stratification may be reasonable in clinical trials targeting neuroprotection.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: No comparative evaluations of anti-dyskinetic drugs to mitigate levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) and OFF time have been performed; head-to-head anti-dyskinetic trials are unlikely to be funded. We sought to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of 12 anti-dyskinetic drugs for peak-dose dyskinesia and OFF time through a Bayesian network meta-analysis.\n\nMETHODS: A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) searched through the databases of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Register of Controlled Trials from incipiency to January 2025. The main endpoints were the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS), modified Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, or the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale IV score for LID and the number of hours of OFF time in a standardized OFF-ON diary for OFF time reduction.\n\nRESULTS: Twenty-one RCTs were included in the analysis. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) indicated that amantadine extended-release (ER) was associated with the largest improvement in the UDysRS (0.934), followed by amantadine immediate-release (IR) (0.680). For OFF time reduction, amantadine IR (0.902) and amantadine ER (0.833) were the two best treatments compared with foliglurax (0.526), mavoglurant (0.464) and sarizotan (0.012). Fipamezole ranked first in overall withdrawals (0.812). Amantadine ER ranked first in withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs) and the incidences of AEs (≥ 1 AEs) (0.900 and 0.887).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Amantadine ER improved dyskinesia significantly versus amantadine IR. Both formulations of amantadine were superior as OFF time-reducing agents compared to other anti-dyskinetic drugs, whereas amantadine IR non-significantly reduced OFF time versus amantadine ER.",

Exercise has been reported to help maintain functional abilities and delay disease progression. However, no consensus exists regarding the type, amount, or timing of exercise for each disease stage. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify rehabilitation interventions and identify optimal approaches based on patient characteristics.\n\nMETHODS: Participants diagnosed with PD or related disorders and residing in an elderly care facility received various rehabilitation therapies-including water stimulation bed, therapeutic massage, sit-to-stand training, gait training, cycle ergometer training, aerobic training using treadmill, stretching, balance training, calisthenics, and resistance training-while wearing a wearable device between April and May 2022. The following parameters were evaluated: differences in body surface temperature and pulse rate before and after rehabilitation, calories burned, steps taken during rehabilitation, and upper and lower extremity activity indices.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 49 participants were included, and the frequency of rehabilitation sessions was determined at the discretion of the therapist based on each participant's condition. Each rehabilitation session was quantified and visualized using radar charts.\n\nDISCUSSION: This study offers insight into the quantification and visualization of rehabilitation effects in patients with progressive neurodegenerative diseases presenting with parkinsonism. Future efforts should focus on accumulating data under standardized conditions and assessing motor symptoms longitudinally to develop personalized rehabilitation programs for patients with neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the nervous system. The neurobiological implications of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in modifying PD risk profile remain incompletely characterized.\n\nMETHODS: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases for relevant studies up to 27 February 2025 to identify eligible clinical investigations. We conducted meta-analyses of covariate-adjusted data to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of different GLP-1RAs in ameliorating both motor and non-motor clinical manifestations within PD cohorts.\n\nRESULTS: We identified six studies from the database for inclusion in the analysis. Meta-analysis demonstrated that GLP-1RAs showed potential benefits in alleviating motor symptoms compared to placebo, though the overall effect did not reach statistical significance (MD =  - 1.08, 95% CI: - 2.87 to 0.71, P = 0.24, I2 = 51%) involving 735 individuals (experiment group n = 413, control group n = 322). Subgroup analysis stratified by pharmacokinetic properties revealed distinct therapeutic responses across GLP-1RA preparations. Short-acting agents significantly improved motor dysfunction (MD =  - 2.93, 95% CI: - 4.72 to - 1.14, P = 0.001, I2 = 0%), whereas long-acting agents showed no symptomatic improvement (MD = 0.43, 95% CI: - 1.13 to 1.99, P = 0.59, I2 = 0%). Non-motor symptom burden, assessed via the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale, HRQoL, MDS-UPDRS Part I, showed no statistically significant improvement in PD patients treated with GLP-1RAs.\n\nCONCLUSION: Short-acting GLP-1RAs could significantly improve motor symptoms, suggesting potential symptomatic benefits. However, the results are not robust enough, and further standardized studies are needed to evaluate their role in disease.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundWe have previously reported that a subset of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis was differentially expressed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. These were associated with compromised biological pathways of mitochondria such as mitochondrial morphology, fragmentation, transmembrane potential and neuronal cell death.ObjectiveTo use an array of energy production genes to determine whether expression changes compromise mitochondrial function and other important biological processes or pathways impacting the development of AD.MethodsRT2-PCR arrays were used to assess expression of mitochondrial energy production genes in AD brains. A subset of genes of interest was identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Expression values from this filtered group of genes were included in a mathematical model being developed to identify potential therapeutic targets for AD.ResultsA majority of these genes was downregulated in AD brains. These AD-related gene expression changes were seen to affect a number of biological functions and pathologic conditions, including synthesis of ATP, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nerve cell viability. Most importantly, UQCRC1, an essential component of RCIII that is also involved in efficient assembly of the mitochondrial respirasome, was identified by our array analysis and, subsequently implicated by inclusion in our mathematical model to be a potential therapeutic target.ConclusionsThere are significant gene expression changes in a small number of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes involved in energy production in AD brains. These affect ROS and nucleotide synthesis and pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways and reflect the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with neuronal cell death and AD.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor and non-motor symptoms. Impaired glymphatic clearance, which eliminates neurotoxic proteins, may contribute to PD pathogenesis. MRI techniques including Diffusion Tensor Imaging-Along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) and assessment of Enlarged Perivascular Spaces (EPVS) are used to evaluate glymphatic function.\n\nOBJECTIVES: Assessment of glymphatic function in PD and its potential as an imaging biomarker.\n\nMETHODS: A systematic search of Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed was conducted on October 27, 2024, for observational MRI studies evaluating glymphatic function in PD. Meta-analyses compared glymphatic indices between people with PD (PwPD) and healthy controls (HCs). Associations with clinical outcomes and participant characteristics were examined using effect-direction plots and meta-correlations.\n\nRESULTS: Thirty-five studies involving 4224 PwPD and 1287 HCs were included. PwPD had lower DTI-ALPS (SMD = -0.97; 95% CI: -1.42, -0.52; p < 0.01; I2 = 91%; k = 15), higher EPVS numbers (SMD = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.37, 1.73; I2 = 94%; k = 9), and higher EPVS volumes (SMD = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.50; I2 = 64%; k = 4) compared to HCs. Glymphatic dysfunction correlated with motor symptom severity (DTI-ALPS: Z-correlation = -0.29; EPVS number: Z-correlation = 0.39). It was not associated with psychiatric symptoms and sex, while associations with global cognition and sleep disturbances were conflicting.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Glymphatic dysfunction is a prominent feature of PD and correlates with motor symptom severity, supporting its potential as a biomarker or potential therapeutic target. Variability in measurement techniques and inconsistent findings on non-motor symptoms highlight the need for further research.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The longer-term benefits of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rt-PA) in Chinese acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients remain lacking. We aimed to evaluate the 1-year clinical outcomes after IV rt-PA for Chinese AIS patients in a real-world setting.\n\nMETHODS: Based on a prospective multicenter stroke registry in China, we analyzed the data of patients with AIS (aged ≥ 18 years) who arrived at hospital within 4.5 h of symptom onset. Participants were from 80 stroke centers in China between January 2017 and March 2020. IV rt-PA-treated patients were propensity score-matched (1:1) by baseline characteristics with non-reperfusion patients. Primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included 1-year functional outcomes.\n\nRESULTS: Participants were mostly male (59.9%), with a mean age of 70.2 years. One-year all-cause mortality was similar between the two groups (11.1% vs. 12.2%; HR, 0.90 [95% CI: 0.78-1.05], p = 0.183). At 1 year, the IV rt-PA group had a higher proportion of functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-2: 70.9% vs. 66.4%; OR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.12-1.39]) and favorable outcome (mRS 0-1: 59.5% vs. 54.6%; OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.11-1.36]) compared to the non-reperfusion group (both p < 0.001). A lower proportion of severe disability/death was also observed in the IV rt-PA group versus the non-reperfusion group (mRS 5-6: 15.9% vs. 20.3%; OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64-0.83]) (all p < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: IV rt-PA treatment in Chinese AIS patients eligible for thrombolysis was associated with improved 1-year functional outcomes despite having similar mortality to those who did not receive any reperfusion treatments.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered on https://clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT0539533.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, regulating the S1P/S1PR pathway, lead to lymphocyte sequestration in lymphoid organs, which results in peripheral lymphopenia. This study evaluates the degree of lymphopenia induced by S1P modulators in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS): Ozanimod, Siponimod, Ponesimod, and Fingolimod.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study across thirteen MS centers in Italy, including 191 MS patients (mean age 46.4 years; 61.3% women). Of these, 28.8% received Siponimod, 26.2% Ozanimod, 24.1% Fingolimod, and 20.9% Ponesimod. Lymphocyte counts were measured at baseline (T0), one month (T1), three months (T3), and six months (T6) post-treatment. Lymphopenia grades range from 0 (≥ 1.0 × 10^9 cells/L) to 4 (< 0.2 × 10^9 cells/L), according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.\n\nRESULTS: At T1, Ozanimod showed a significantly higher mean lymphocyte count than Siponimod and Fingolimod (p < 0.001), Ponesimod higher mean lymphocyte count than Siponimod (p = 0.006). The differences persisted between Ozanimod than Siponimod and Fingolimod at T3 (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04), and between Ponesimod and Siponimod at T6 (p = 0.03). Severe lymphopenia cases were significantly higher in Siponimod than in Ponesimod and Ozanimod, at T1 (p = 0.001 and p = 0.0001). The differences remained significant between Ozanimod and Siponimod, at T3 (p = 0.001), and between Ponesimod and Siponimod, Fingolimod and Ozanimod, at T6 (p = 0.001). Grade 4 lymphopenia was observed in Ozanimod and Siponimod at T3.\n\nCONCLUSION: This is the first real-world, head-to-head observational study comparing lymphopenia among different S1P modulators. Our results might assist in therapy choice depending on patients baseline hematological characteristics.",

The objective of this study was to compile a comprehensive list of MRI lesions, and to quantify the utility of these lesions in distinguishing between these conditions.\n\nMETHODS: We searched for articles comparing MRI lesion frequency in MS, AQP4-Ab + ve NMOSD, MOGAD and healthy controls. Bayesian network meta-analysis together with pairwise and pooled case-case comparison analyses to develop sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were undertaken.\n\nRESULTS: Sixty-six articles were reported on 2933 MS, 3296 AQP4-Ab + ve NMOSD, and 1559 MOGAD cases, and 561 healthy controls. MRI lesions associated with MS were: periventricular T2, subcortical white matter T2, Dawson's finger, U-fibre T2 lesion, posterior spinal column T2, inferior temporal T2, cortical T2, brain T1 hypointensity (black holes), peripheral spinal cord T2, pons T2, unilateral optic nerve T2 and brain gadolinium enhancing lesions. Optic chiasm T2, LETM, bright spotty spinal cord T2, area postrema T2, hypothalamic T2, spinal cord atrophy and optic tract T2 lesions were associated with AQP4-Ab + ve NMOSD. Conus medullaris T2, fluffy, perineural enhancement, peri-ependymal 3rd ventricle T2 and peri-ependymal 4th ventricle T2 lesions were associated with MOGAD.\n\nDISCUSSION: This review identified MRI features supportive of a diagnosis of MS, NMOSD or MOGAD, and has clarified the diagnostic utility of various MRI lesion characteristics, to aid in future clinical decision-making and guide future approaches to research.",

This study examines the association between NPS and neurodegeneration-related plasma biomarkers in older adults with and without dementia in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\nMETHODS: Eighty-five individuals (≥65 years) underwent dementia adjudication using the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSID) and Alzheimer's Questionnaire (AQ). Plasma biomarkers (amyloid β [Aβ] 42/40, phosphorylated-tau181 [p-tau181], neurofilament light [NfL], glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), interleukin-1β [IL-1β], tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]) were measured. NPS were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI) (for dementia cases). Logistic regressions examined associations between NPS and biomarkers, adjusting for age, sex, and education.\n\nRESULTS: NPS were common in dementia cases, with irritability (57.8%) and depression (90.7%) most frequent. GFAP was linked to irritability (odds ratio [OR] = 3.34, p = 0.01), and NfL and GFAP were associated with depressive symptoms (OR = 0.76, p = 0.04; OR = 1.98, p = 0.02, respectively).\n\nDISCUSSION: These findings highlight the burden of NPS in the DRC and suggest biomarker-driven mechanisms, emphasizing the need for further research in diverse populations.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: Identifies neuropsychiatric symptoms as early indicators of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression.

        "Abstract": "Large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke represents a leading cause of disability despite successful endovascular treatment (EVT). Venous outflow has recently emerged as a potential predictor of functional outcome in ischemic stroke. We aimed to investigate whether a comprehensive venous drainage evaluation is associated with stroke evolution and functional outcome. Prospective study on acute stroke patients with anterior LVO who underwent optimal recanalization from February 2023 to February 2024. Opacification and drainage time of superficial and deep veins were evaluated on digital subtraction angiography sequences. Clinical outcome was functional recovery at 90 days, whereas neuroradiological outcomes were ischemic lesion growth (ILG) and hemorrhagic transformation (HT). Multivariate logistic and linear regression models were performed. 24/50 patients (48%) displayed an unfavorable outcome, 14/50 (28%) a HT, and 28/50 (56%) an ILG. Longer median washout times of the superficial venous system were independently associated with a higher risk of poor functional outcome (aOR = 1.32; 95% CI 1.02-1.79; p = 0.049), ILG (aB = 3.06; SE 1.26; p = 0.020) and HT (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI 1.21-2.47; p = 0.005), and cortical frontal veins were the best predictor within veins' group. Opacification of Labbè and superficial middle cerebral veins predicted only HT (aOR = 0.178; 95% CI 0.026-0.766, p = 0.041) and ILG (aB = 9.78; SE 2.75; p = 0.003), respectively. In this cohort of LVO acute ischemic stroke patients with an optimal recanalization after EVT, qualitative and quantitative aspects of venous outflow were independent predictors of stroke evolution and functional outcome. A comprehensive venous outflow evaluation represents a potential target for a tailored management of patients after EVT.",

        "Abstract": "This study provided a preliminary examination of indices of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sleep disruptions in adults with Down syndrome (DS), and their associations with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and symptomatology. Ninety-three adults with DS (aged 25-61 years) from the Alzheimer Biomarker Consortium - Down Syndrome completed cognitive assessments, MRI and PET scans (assessing amyloid-beta [Aβ] and tau), and a one-night home sleep study using the WatchPAT-300 device. Study partners also reported on depressive symptoms and diagnoses. Correlational analyses examined relationships between sleep variables, PET biomarkers, and AD symptomatology (cognitive functioning and depressive mood), controlling for sociodemographics. Eighty-one participants (87%) completed valid WatchPAT data. Of these, 60 (74%) screened positive for OSA, and an additional 11 had a prior OSA diagnosis and used CPAP during the test night. Nearly half (45%) of those screening positive for OSA had no prior diagnosis, indicating under-detection. Among the 22 participants using OSA treatment, 50% continued to show sleep-disordered breathing, suggesting suboptimal treatment effectiveness. Higher wake percentage and shorter total sleep time were associated with greater Aβ and tau burden. Cognitive performance was negatively associated with wake percentage, total sleep time, and oxygenation indices (minimum oxygen, desaturation, and time ≤ 88% oxygen). Depressive symptoms were negatively related to total sleep time. These findings add preliminary evidence linking sleep disruption and OSA with AD-related pathology and symptomatology. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these associations and evaluate whether improving sleep quality and treating OSA may help delay AD onset in this high-risk population.",

        "Abstract": "Late-onset depression (LOD) is closely linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), marked by shared biological pathways and common risk factors. The neurobiological alterations associated with depression, particularly the dysregulation of amyloid-β (Aβ), play a critical role in the acceleration of disease progression. In individuals suffering from LOD, Aβ peptides - specifically Aβ40 and Aβ42 - exhibit distinct profiles in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain tissue, highlighting the substantial influence of AD pathology. Central to this relationship is A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10), an essential α-secretase that exerts a protective effect by decreasing Aβ formation through the non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Furthermore, ADAM10 regulates the shedding of Neuronal Growth Regulator 1 (Negr1), a protein intricately linked to both LOD and AD, thereby enhancing synaptic plasticity and neuronal development - two critical processes in addressing these challenging disorders. Given the rapidly rising prevalence of both depression and dementia in aging populations, understanding these molecular interactions is more urgent than ever. Despite growing evidence, the interplay among LOD, AD, ADAM10, and Negr1 remains insufficiently explored, particularly in diverse populations. This review synthesizes recent advancements that illuminate the complex interactions among LOD, AD, and the regulatory function of ADAM10, particularly concerning one of its substrates, Negr1. By elucidating these fundamental interactions, the study paves the way for innovative treatment approaches aimed at both LOD and AD, advocating for a synergistic strategy to address these multifaceted conditions effectively, meeting a critical and time-sensitive challenge in global brain health.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundDementia is characterized by a deterioration in cognitive functions that impacts everyday tasks and overall life quality, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the most prevalent form. As dementia progresses, cognitive rehabilitation, often utilized in conjunction with telemedicine, offers significant support via targeted interventions that enhance autonomy and overall quality of life (QoL).ObjectiveThis systematic review aims to explore the potential and barriers of telemedicine-based cognitive stimulation and training programs for individuals with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).MethodsStudies were identified from an online search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsychINFO, and Scopus databases conducted up to 19 February 2025. This systematic review has been registered on PROSPERO under the following number: CRD42024615619.ResultsThe studies establish that digital health interventions and telehealth approaches add to the improvement in cognitive rehabilitation among patients with dementia and MCI, by indicating striking improvements not only in cognitive functioning but also in increased support for caregivers. The higher adherence and satisfaction rates with such interventions can be attributed to telemedicine itself and newer technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and transcranial direct current stimulation, which can provide options for personalized and accessible care in neurodegenerative disease management.ConclusionsTelemedicine-based cognitive rehabilitation in dementia patients, not only achieves improved cognitive functioning but also a better QoL and reduced caregiver burden. Further studies are needed to ensure equal implementation and long-term sustainability of these interventions, possibly with the inclusion of newer technologies such as VR and neuromodulation.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Comparative assessments of all available disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in patients with highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) are lacking, even though some of these DMTs are restricted to this MS subpopulation. We therefore aimed to compare DMTs in patients with highly active RRMS using re-analyses of individual patient data (IPD) provided by study sponsors.\n\nMETHODS: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included adult patients with RRMS and directly compared alemtuzumab, cladribine, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ozanimod, ponesimod and teriflunomide, or compared these DMTs with other drugs or placebo. Re-analyses of IPD for subpopulations of patients with high disease activity despite previous DMT were included in network meta-analyses (NMAs). As there is no widely accepted definition of high disease activity in RRMS, criteria were chosen to cover as wide a range of definitions as possible, while being sufficiently similar across studies.\n\nRESULTS: We identified 14 relevant RCTs, including only 3 head-to-head comparisons of DMTs, and no relevant studies on natalizumab. All studies were pivotal studies for approval. The available re-analyses of IPD did not allow comprehensive NMAs. The main reasons for this were the overall paucity of RCTs, especially head-to-head comparisons, and a high risk of bias. In addition, data on patient-relevant outcomes and long-term follow-up (> 2 years) were lacking.\n\nCONCLUSION: Based on the largest possible evidence base, including previously unpublished data, our systematic review shows substantial evidence gaps for DMTs in highly active RRMS. This indicates a need for further research beyond regulatory requirements.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trial number: not applicable.",

        "Abstract": "Neurodegeneration is a hallmark of various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, and neurotropic viral infections. Although the precise etiology remains unclear, multiple pathological mechanisms contribute to disease progression, including mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation, calcium excitotoxicity, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, immune system activation, and neuroinflammation. Among these, the immune response plays a crucial role in disease pathogenesis, acting as a defense mechanism against damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and toxic molecular species. Chronic immune activation, particularly of microglia, is a defining feature of neuroinflammation, which involves both innate and adaptive immune responses. In the central nervous system (CNS), microglia-mediated neuroinflammation leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines, exacerbating neuronal damage. Necroptosis, a regulated form of programmed cell death, has been implicated in neuroinflammatory disorders, including PD. Persistent microglial activation in response to aggregated proteins stimulates various microglial receptors, which includes Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), that play a pivotal role in necroptosis activation via the myeloid differentiating primary response gene 88 (MYD88)-independent pathway. This review explores how immune system-mediated receptor activation triggers cell death pathways, with a focus on TLR-induced necroptosis in PD. In addition, we also discuss various downstream molecular mechanisms linking TLR signaling to necroptosis and discuss the potential of TLRs as therapeutic targets, offering insights for developing neuroprotective strategies in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDS).",

        "Abstract": "TMEM106B is a lysosome/late endosome protein that is a potent genetic modifier of multiple neurodegenerative diseases as well as general aging. Recently, TMEM106B was shown to form insoluble aggregates in postmortem human brain tissue, drawing attention to TMEM106B pathology and the potential role of TMEM106B aggregation in disease. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, TMEM106B has been studied in vivo using animal models of neurodegeneration, but these studies rely on overexpression or knockdown approaches. To date, endogenous TMEM106B pathology and its relationship to known canonical pathology in animal models has not been reported. Here, we analyze histological patterns of the endogenous TMEM106B protein in murine models of C9ORF72-related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD), SOD1-related ALS, and tauopathy using an extensively validated TMEM106B antibody. We found profound correlations between the endogenous TMEM106B protein with known TDP-43 and tau pathology in murine models of C9-ALS/FTD and tauopathy, respectively. By using an antibody previously shown to recognize the pathologic TMEM106B C-terminal fragments, we then performed a similar analysis on postmortem brain tissues from patients with C9-ALS/FTD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and AD with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (AD/LATE). Convergent evidence from both murine models and human patients links TMEM106B to TDP-43 nuclear clearance at the cellular level in C9-ALS. By characterizing endogenous TMEM106B in mice and human postmortem tissue, our work reveals essential considerations that must be taken when analyzing data from in vivo mouse studies and elucidates new insights supporting the involvement of TMEM106B in the pathogenesis and progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases.",

We used generalized linear models for cognitive scores, logistic regression for cognitive status transitions, and Cox models for dementia risk associated with changes in sleep dimensions.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 8994 and 14720 participants were involved in the change-to-change analyses and change-to-dementia analyses, respectively. Compared to individuals who maintained their original sleep dimensions, those who changed their sleep duration to the optimal range (7-8 hours/day) or shifted chronotype to morningness exhibited higher overall cognitive scores (β =0.15, P =0.037; β =0.23, P =0.011). Conversely, transitioning to non-optimal sleep duration (OR =1.07, P =0.034) or declining overall sleep quality (OR =1.06, P =0.006) increased the risk of cognitive decline from normal baseline. Napping cessation increased the risk of MCI progression to dementia (OR =1.16, P =0.001). Transitioning to non-optimal sleep duration (HR =1.82, P =0.005) and discontinuing napping (HR =2.13, P =0.015) were associated with a higher incident of all-cause dementia.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Maintaining optimal or optimizing sleep duration, preserving napping habits, and transitioning to a morning chronotype are essential for dementia prevention.",

        "Abstract": "This study explores the potential of novel molecules that can act as copper chelators to treat Alzheimer's disease. Eight imines L03-10 and one quinoline-based compound L11 were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated as compounds that can act to reverse neurodegeneration in vivo. Their ability to extract copper from the Cu-β-amyloid complex, a key factor in Alzheimer's pathology, was assessed, achieving a remarkable in vitro activity for L09, L10, and L11. They effectively extracted it from the Cu-β-amyloid complex, which was confirmed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In silico studies predicted that compounds L09, L10, and L11 demonstrated favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, suggesting suitability for oral administration and blood-brain barrier permeability. Cellular studies showed that compounds L09 and L10 (at concentrations up to 500 μM) exhibited low cytotoxicity. They reduced lipid peroxidation and DNA damage induced by beta-amyloid oligomers at lower concentrations. Compound L11 showed more significant cytotoxicity but reduced beta-amyloid-induced DNA damage. In vivo studies (STZ-induced Alzheimer's rat model) proved that compound L10 significantly reduced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and restored copper homeostasis in the hippocampus. This was accompanied by improved spatial memory performance in the Barnes maze test. Compounds L09 and L11 showed less impact on these parameters. The study presents compelling evidence that specifically designed copper chelators could offer a new therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. Compound L10 is an up-and-coming candidate and warrants further investigation. The detailed in silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses provide a solid motivation for future research and drug development efforts.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits significant clinical and pathological heterogeneity, particularly during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) transitional stage. Current understanding of the molecular drivers underlying distinct MCI progression trajectories remains incomplete, hindering the development of personalized interventions.ObjectiveThis study aims to integrate transcriptomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic data to identify distinct trajectories in the progression from MCI to AD, and to explore the underlying disease heterogeneity.MethodsWe integrated transcriptomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic data from MCI patients to model the progression to AD and stratified them into subtypes. We then examined molecular differences between MCI and AD within each subtype, identifying key immune microenvironments and regulatory pathways via immune cell infiltration analysis, WGCNA, and GO/KEGG analyses. Finally, we applied Cox regression to identify prognostic biomarkers and built a random forest prognostic model.ResultsOur analysis identified two distinct MCI-to-AD progression subtypes. Subtype 1 was marked by metabolic dysregulation and slower cognitive decline, while Subtype 2 was driven by chronic immune activation and exhibited faster cognitive decline. The trajectory subtypes captured molecular perturbations that were missed by traditional unclustered methods. Prognostic models based on these molecular signatures predicted disease progression over 1-5 years, with AUROC values ranging from 0.851 to 0.893 for Subtype 1 and from 0.878 to 0.927 for Subtype 2.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the importance of multi-omics trajectory stratification in understanding the heterogeneity of AD progression. The identification of two distinct progression trajectories provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of AD.",

The most common neurodegenerative pathologies were Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and limbic-predominant age-related transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 encephalopathy (LATE). The addition of various combinations of comorbid CVD, LBD, and LATE to ADNC worsened overall performance on cognitive and neuropsychological testing across time.

Cox proportional hazard regression analyses using four different models were performed to compare the risk of developing PD among the four BMI-metabolic status phenotypes.ResultsDuring the median follow-up of 13.5 years, 2283 (0.6%) patients were newly diagnosed with PD. Cox regression models demonstrated that individuals with overweight/obesity and those with metabolic abnormalities were at a higher risk of developing PD than their counterparts. Compared with the metabolically healthy non-overweight group (reference group), the two metabolically abnormal groups (either overweight/obese or non-overweight) showed a higher incidence of PD. The metabolically healthy overweight/obese group exhibited a comparable risk of developing PD to the metabolically healthy non-overweight group.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that metabolically abnormal conditions are more relevant to incident PD than overweight/obesity. In particular, a metabolically healthy overweight/obese status does not increase the risk of developing PD compared with a metabolically healthy non-overweight status.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The hippocampus is a key brain region for episodic memory, and impairment of episodic memory is the earliest feature of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Preserving the structure and function of the hippocampus plays a key role in preventing progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, early intervention is crucial, and acupuncture could significantly improve episodic memory in aMCI, but the mechanism is not clear. Accordingly, this experiment aims to explore the mechanism of acupuncture to improve episodic memory in aMCI based on the hippocampal subregion.\n\nMETHODS: A randomized, controlled, blinded research will be performed. 150 aMCI participants will be assigned to the verum acupuncture group, sham acupuncture group, and waiting group; 50 healthy controls will also be recruited. Patients in the acupuncture group will receive real acupuncture treatment or placebo acupuncture three times per week, 36 sessions over 12 consecutive weeks in total. Patients in the waiting group will receive the same verum acupuncture treatment for compensation after the trials are finished. The primary outcome will be the auditory-verbal learning test. Secondary outcomes will include Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and 12 weeks after randomization. Repeated measurement analysis of variance will be used to explore the intervention effect.\n\nDISCUSSION: This protocol will provide theoretical support for the neural mechanisms by which acupuncture improves episodic memory in aMCI. We hope that this study will provide objective evidence and offer alternative treatment options for the early treatment of aMCI.\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR2400084308.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundSupporting persons with dementia and their caregivers is a global public health priority. However, current research typically relies on subjective caregiver reports, lacking the integration of objective physiological indicators.ObjectiveTo identify the determinants of caregiver burden among family caregivers of persons with dementia, guided by a biopsychosocial framework.MethodsSeventy-five dyads of persons with dementia and their caregivers participated in this study. The determinants of caregiver burden, including biological, psychological, and social factors, were assessed using sweat patches, actigraphy, and surveys, and analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression analysis.ResultsThe mean caregiver burden score was 42.32. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that psychological factors explained 39.3% of the variance in caregiver burden. A 17.5% increase was observed by the addition of biological factors, accounting for 56.8% of the variance. Among the biological factors, high level of pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α in persons with dementia was significantly associated with increased caregiver burden. In contrast, long total sleep time was associated with decreased caregiver burden. Amidst psychological factors, not only increased depressive symptoms but also severe behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in individuals with dementia were significantly associated with increased caregiver burden.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the importance of tailored interventions that address both biological and psychological factors to reduce caregiver burden and improve care outcomes. Additionally, by alleviating caregiver burden, these interventions may also support ageing-in-place, allowing persons with dementia to remain in familiar environments within their communities.",

We assessed body weight, spontaneous locomotor activity via open field testing, and conducted comprehensive metabolomic analyses using untargeted LC-MS and GC-MS.ResultsNicotine administration did not significantly affect body weight or locomotor activity in either genotype. In LC-MS, DKO-B mice showed dysregulation in purine metabolism, amino acid pathways, mTOR signaling, and lipolysis compared to WT-B mice. DKO mice showed disruptions in steroid hormone biosynthesis and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, suggest altered stress responses and immune dysfunction after nicotine administration. In WT mice, distinct changes in amino acid metabolism and drug interaction pathways were observed. In GC-MS, Central carbon metabolism emerged as the most enriched pathway in DKO-B versus WT-B mice. WT-N enrichments included the TCA cycle, cholesterol metabolism, and amino acid pathways, while DKO-N changes involved branched-chain amino acid metabolism, ketone body metabolism, and the pentose phosphate pathway.ConclusionsChronic nicotine elicits distinct metabolic responses in healthy versus neurodegenerative conditions.

        "Abstract": "BackgroundType 2 diabetes (T2D) is a prevalent metabolic condition associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). While both T2D and AD are linked to neurodegeneration, the extent to which their patterns of brain atrophy overlap remain unclear.ObjectiveTo assess the similarities and differences in cortical atrophy patterns among individuals with controlled and uncontrolled T2D, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD.MethodsStructural magnetic resonance imaging data from the UK Biobank (UKBB) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed. Participants aged 55 and older were selected. Linear regression models were applied to generate cortical thickness maps for each group, controlling for age and sex. Group comparisons were conducted using permutation-based tests accounting for spatial autocorrelation.ResultsThe study included 175 individuals with T2D (86 uncontrolled, 89 controlled) and 127 healthy controls without diabetes (HC) from UKBB, 334 individuals with MCI, 119 with AD and 315 cognitively healthy (CH) from ADNI. Uncontrolled T2D was associated with significant cortical atrophy in specific brain regions, with partial overlap in neurodegeneration patterns observed in MCI and AD. However, correlations between the cortical thinning patterns were weak and non-significant, suggesting distinct trajectories. Controlled T2D showed no significant cortical thinning, supporting the potential neuroprotective effects of glycemic control.ConclusionsUncontrolled T2D is linked to region-specific cortical atrophy that partially overlaps with MCI and AD but follows an independent neurodegenerative trajectory. Effective diabetes management may help preserve brain structure and reduce dementia risk, highlighting the importance of early metabolic intervention.",

Thus, the prospect of a possible future with AD can raise significant concerns.ObjectiveTo investigate Latinos' concerns and actions or planning they undertook to address those concerns after receiving an estimate of their risk of developing late-onset AD by age 85.MethodsFollowing receipt of their AD risk information, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 191 Latinos aged 40-64 who participated in the Información de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer para Latinos (IDEAL) Study. Interviews were conducted in Spanish or English at 6 weeks, 9- and 15-months following risk disclosure.ResultsFifty-nine participants (30%) had begun planning for a possible future with AD. Some spoke to family members about not wanting to become a burden to them and requested to be placed in a nursing home if they developed AD. Some contemplated making changes to their retirement plans to ensure access to their informal support networks for future care needs. Others with future financial concerns started to save more money and investigate their social security/employee benefits. Several started to get their financial/legal affairs in order, discussed future care wishes with family, educated family about AD, and changed their life plans to ensure they did certain things while still cognitively intact.ConclusionsAD risk information may motivate Latinos to engage in planning for a possible future with AD, enabling them to retain a sense of personal control and prepare to deal with its consequences.Clinical trial statementClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04471779 Date Registered: July 15, 2020Registry Name: The IDEAL Study: Information About Alzheimer's Disease for Latinos in New York City.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and neuronal damage. Cadmium exposure has been implicated in AD pathogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of Ebixa (memantine), Ginkgo biloba, and selenium in a cadmium-induced rat model of AD. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into six groups: control, control + Ginkgo-treated, cadmium chloride (CdCl2), CdCl2 + Ebixa-treated, CdCl2 + Ginkgo, and CdCl2 + Ginkgo + Selenium. Behavioral tests, including the Morris water maze and passive avoidance learning, were conducted. Additionally, biochemical analysis of acetylcholine (Ach), choline acetyltransferase (AchT), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels in brain homogenates was performed. Histological sections of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and medulla were examined. Apoptotic assessment was conducted using the TUNEL assay. CdCl2 exposure resulted in cognitive deficits, reduced Ach levels, and neuronal damage, mirroring AD-like characteristics. Ebixa treatment improved spatial memory behavior as well as Ach, AchT and AChE levels in the brain. Ginkgo biloba and selenium co-administration increased the number of crossings in the Morris water maze test, suggesting memory preservation. Additionally, Ginkgo biloba exhibited potential cholinergic system protective effects. Histological analysis revealed neuroprotection in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and medulla. TUNEL assays demonstrated anti-apoptotic effects of both Ebixa and the combination of Ginkgo and selenium. Ebixa, Ginkgo biloba, and selenium showed promise in mitigating cognitive deficits and preserving neuronal structures in a CdCl2-induced AD manifestation in rats. These findings provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies for AD and warrant further investigation.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents challenges in early diagnosis and progression prediction. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly convolutional-neural-networks (CNNs), show promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and prognostic capabilities using neuroimaging data. The aims of this study were: (i) develop a 3D-CNN based on MRI to distinguish controls and PD patients and (ii) employ CNN to predict the progression of PD.\n\nMETHODS: Three cohorts were selected: 86 mild, 62 moderate-to-severe PD patients, and 60 controls; 14 mild-PD patients and 14 controls from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database, and 38 de novo mild-PD patients and 38 controls. All participants underwent MRI scans and clinical evaluation at baseline and over 2-years. PD subjects were classified in two clusters of different progression using k-means clustering based on baseline and follow-up UDPRS-III scores. A 3D-CNN was built and tested on PD patients and controls, with binary classifications: controls vs moderate-to-severe PD, controls vs mild-PD, and two clusters of PD progression. The effect of transfer learning was also tested.\n\nRESULTS: CNN effectively differentiated moderate-to-severe PD from controls (74% accuracy) using MRI data alone. Transfer learning significantly improved performance in distinguishing mild-PD from controls (64% accuracy). For predicting disease progression, the model achieved over 70% accuracy by combining MRI and clinical data. Brain regions most influential in the CNN's decisions were visualized.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: CNN, integrating multimodal data and transfer learning, provides encouraging results toward early-stage classification and progression monitoring in PD. Its explainability through activation maps offers potential for clinical application in early diagnosis and personalized monitoring.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by a broad spectrum of non-motor symptoms. Defining non-motor subtypes may help clarify early pathophysiological mechanisms, predict disease progression, and guide personalized care.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To identify non-motor PD subtypes through an unsupervised approach, evaluate their consistency with proposed models of PD pathology, and assess their prognostic value.\n\nMETHODS: Data from 824 newly diagnosed, drug-naïve PD patients enrolled in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative were analyzed. Five core non-motor features at baseline-REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), hyposmia, dysautonomia, anxiety, and cognitive impairment-were used for two-step cluster analysis. Cluster-wise progression to Hoehn and Yahr stage 3, motor complications, and dementia was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.\n\nRESULTS: Three non-motor clusters emerged. Cluster 1 (RBD-/hyposmia+, n = 474) included patients with mild anxiety and selective cognitive deficits. Cluster 2 (RBD+, n = 219) exhibited the greatest non-motor burden, including dysautonomia, psychiatric symptoms, and global cognitive impairment. These patients were older at diagnosis and showed more symmetric and axial motor signs, faster progression to Hoehn and Yahr stage 3, and a higher risk of dementia. Cluster 3 (RBD-/hyposmia-, n = 131) displayed minimal non-motor involvement. No differences were found in time to motor complications across clusters.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to identify PD subtypes based exclusively on early non-motor symptoms in a large, untreated cohort. The resulting data-driven clusters aligned with some proposed models of PD pathology and demonstrated clear, independent prognostic value for progression to Hoehn and Yahr stage 3 and dementia risk.",

        "Abstract": "Migraine and functional neurological disorder (FND) are two of the most common conditions in neurological practice. It is assumed that the two conditions have distinct underlying mechanisms. However, it can be clinically challenging to disentangle their relative contributions to a patient's symptoms. In addition, apart from the relationship between persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) and migraine, the frequency of co-occurrence has not been characterized in detail. Contemporary conceptualizations of FND have driven a re-evaluation of its relationship to other neurological disorders, including migraine. We carried out a narrative review of the literature examining the co-occurrence of migraine and FND. We also explored their comorbidities, aetiological risk factors and mechanisms, focusing especially on areas of potential overlap. Our review suggests increased frequency of migraine in people with functional seizures compared to epilepsy, but data from people with functional motor symptoms is mixed. Robust epidemiological studies evaluating the frequency of FND in migraine are lacking. Similar to other neurological disorders, migraine is an established trigger of FND. Female gender, adverse childhood experiences and comorbid psychiatric and functional disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia, are more common in both conditions than in controls, but perhaps more so in FND. Mechanistic research in both conditions highlights converging frameworks of dysregulated allostatic/stress responses in the context of predictive processing models of the brain. This has implications for pharmaceutical and rehabilitation treatments. The relationship between migraine and FND is poorly studied. An overview of their overlap offers a model of non-dualistic thinking within a clinical neuroscience framework for future studies.",

Glial cells-astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes-play essential roles in AD progression, but their pathway-specific genetic contributions remain unclear.ObjectiveTo identify glial cell type-specific biological pathways associated with AD using pathway-based polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis.MethodsWe applied PRSet to evaluate associations between glial-specific pathways and AD in a discovery dataset (ADc1234ADA), adjusting for the top two principal components (Model 1), and additionally for sex, age, and APOE ε4 status (Model 2). Pathways with nominal significance (p < 0.05) were further tested in an independent replication dataset (ADNI). Results from both datasets were meta-analyzed and assessed for statistical significance using Bonferroni correction. Competitive p-values were used to determine the relative contribution of each pathway within glial types. Genes from significant pathways were used in a follow-up gene-based PRS analysis, following the same modeling and validation steps.ResultsIn Model 1, we identified six significant astrocytic, six microglial, and five oligodendrocyte pathways. In Model 2, five astrocytic and four oligodendrocytic pathways remained significant; no microglial pathways met significance. The top pathways were the immune system in astrocytes, antigen processing in microglia, and transport and trafficking in oligodendrocytes. At the gene level, BCL3 and BIN1 were significant in Model 1, while only BIN1 remained in Model 2.ConclusionsThese findings highlight distinct glia-specific genetic contributions to AD, particularly involving immune-related pathways, and demonstrate the value of cell-type-specific PRS approaches in AD research.",

Investigating dFNC may provide valuable insights into the complex clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, research on dynamic FC alterations in AD remain limited. This study aimed to comprehensively characterize dFNC patterns in patients with AD.\n\nMETHODS: A total of 100 patients diagnosed with AD and 69 with healthy controls (HC) were included. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were analyzed using a sliding-window approach and k-means clustering based on independent component analysis to examine dFNC alterations. Correlation analyses were conducted to assess associations between dFNC variations and clinical scores in individuals with AD. Additionally, an exploratory multivariate pattern analysis was performed to classify AD across different dFNC states.\n\nRESULTS: Four recurrent connectivity states were identified. In state III, patients with AD exhibited a significantly longer mean dwell time and a higher fractional time compared to the HC group, whereas the opposite trend was observed in state IV. In state III, both fractional time and mean dwell time were negatively correlated with cognitive scores. Significant differences in FC strength were observed between states II and III. The highest classification accuracy for distinguishing AD was achieved in state II, which was characterized by intra- and inter-network dysfunction across multiple functional networks.\n\nCONCLUSION: Distinct alterations in dFNC were identified, with significant associations observed between connectivity patterns and clinical symptoms.

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a complex neurological disorder characterized by recurrent, disabling headaches and various sensory symptoms, affecting about 15% of the global population annually. It is the second most common neurological condition worldwide, causing significant disability. While current prophylactic treatments include beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway, not all patients respond adequately. Atogepant, an oral CGRP receptor antagonist, has emerged as a promising option for migraine prevention with improved tolerability.\n\nMETHODS: This meta-analysis follows PRISMA guidelines, involving a comprehensive search of Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases up to July 2024. Efficacy outcomes included mean monthly migraine days (MMDs), mean monthly headache days (MHDs), monthly acute medication use days and the percentage of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs. Safety outcomes were measured by adverse events (AEs). Statistical analysis employed the Inverse Variance and Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models, with heterogeneity assessed using the I² index.\n\nRESULTS: Six RCTs with 4325 patients (3054 on Atogepant, 1271 on placebo) met the inclusion criteria. The combined analysis indicated a significant reduction in MMDs favoring Atogepant over placebo (SMD - 0.39, 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.33; p < 0.00001; I²=0%). Similarly, significant reductions were observed in MHDs, monthly acute medication use days, and the proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs.\n\nCONCLUSION: Atogepant is an effective and safe option for migraine prophylaxis, showing significant reductions in MMDs. Further extensive trials are recommended to assess the long-term efficacy, safety, and cost efficiency of Atogepant compared to other preventive medications.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inhibition of Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome within the central nervous system (CNS) is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).\n\nOBJECTIVES: This phase 1b open-label study was conducted in elderly healthy volunteers (HV) and PD patients. The study was designed to assess safety and tolerability and to evaluate the central and systemic pharmacokinetic profile and anti-inflammatory effects of a total daily dose of 300 mg NT-0796 (oral 150 mg suspension capsule formulation every 12 h).\n\nMETHODS: Four elderly HV and 10 subjects with PD received 150 mg open-label NT-0796 every 12 h for either 7 or 28 days, respectively. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected via serial sampling or lumbar punctures for pharmacokinetic and biomarker analyses. Standard safety parameters were monitored throughout.\n\nRESULTS: NT-0796 was safe and well tolerated with minimal adverse events. A reduced peak-to-trough ratio along with moderately higher exposure than the solution formulation (used in the first-in-human study) was observed, along with significant CSF exposure in elderly HV and subjects with PD. NT-0796 drove reductions in systemic inflammatory markers including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-18. Furthermore, reductions in neuroinflammation, including IL-1β, were indicative of NT-0796's target engagement within the central nervous system (CNS) of subjects with PD.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: CNS inhibition of NLRP3 with NT-0796 reduced neuroinflammation over a sustained 28-day dosing period and demonstrates the potential for long-term dosing of NT-0796 in future studies of patients with neurodegeneration. © 2025 NodThera Limited.

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with adverse health outcomes. However, the association with dementia remains uncertain. Thus, we examined the association of OSA with all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a Danish nationwide population-based cohort study using health registries. Patients with OSA were identified from 1995 to 2017. Furthermore, a propensity score-matched comparison cohort was defined. Propensity scores were computed based on age, sex, comorbidities and education. With follow-up until 2018, we computed incidence rates (IRs) and HRs for all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Subgroup analyses were conducted by sex, age, overweight/obesity, hypertension and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.\n\nRESULTS: We identified 62 928 patients with OSA and 62 928 in the propensity score-matched comparison cohort (76% male, median age 52 years). The IR for all-cause dementia was 1.27 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.37) per 1000 person-years in patients with OSA and 1.15 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.25) in the propensity score-matched comparison cohort, yielding an HR of 1.10 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.24). The HR for Alzheimer's disease was 1.16 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.43). Among individuals with overweight/obesity, the HR for all-cause dementia was 0.71 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.99), while it was 1.17 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.33) in those without. CPAP treatment attenuated associations.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings support a modest association between OSA and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, motivating early clinical detection of OSA as a potentially modifiable risk factor for subsequent dementia. The finding that the dementia hazard was not increased in the setting of overweight or obesity requires further study and points to the need for research on mechanisms underlying the association between OSA and dementia.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish recommendations based on an expert consensus on the early and appropriate use of high-efficacy disease-modifying therapies (HE-DMTs) in the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, based on current clinical evidence and real-world practice in Italy.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A Delphi panel comprising 65 neurologists from 54 Italian MS centers engaged in a two-round consensus process. Experts rated 43 statements across five domains: therapeutic goals, definitions of HE-DMT, MS patient profiling, and use of HE-DMT at diagnosis and later in MS course, using a 5-point Likert scale. A statement reached strong consensus if ≥80% of panelists agreed; whereas between 70% and 80% it was considered as moderate.\n\nRESULTS: In Round 2, 53 experts completed the survey on 43 statements. Strong consensus was achieved for 33 (76.7%), and moderate consensus for 6 (14.0%) statements. Experts strongly supported early HE-DMT initiation to prevent irreversible disability, endorsed a multidimensional definitions of treatment efficacy, and recommended personalized approaches based on clinical, radiological, and biomarker indicators. Consensus supported initiating HE-DMTs in patients with poor prognostic features and identified magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity, neurodegeneration markers, and suboptimal clinical response as specific factors requiring escalation to HE-DMTs.\n\nCONCLUSION: This Italian Delphi underscores the importance of early, personalized HE-DMT use to optimize long-term outcomes in MS. The strong expert alignment reflects a paradigm shift toward proactive treatment and highlights actionable clinical, radiological, and biological indicators that should guide therapeutic decisions. These findings may support national policy changes and promote more equitable and evidence-based access to HE-DMTs across healthcare systems.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-fat diet (HFD) consumption is linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying changes in the mRNA expression due to the ingestion of HFD in the intestine-often called the second brain due to its dense enteric neurons-could offer insights into AD development and progression.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study assesses whether the introduction of HFD at adult-age influence expression of AD-related genes in the intestines of Wild-type (WT) or the amyloid precursor protein/presenilin1 (APP/PS1)-overexpressing Transgenic (TG) rats.\n\nMETHODS: Twelve-month-old WT and TG rats (male and female) were fed a control diet (CD; 8% energy from fat), or HFD (45% energy from fat) for six months. Ileal tissues were assessed for the mRNA expression of genes responsible for development/progression of AD.\n\nRESULTS: The WT HFD-fed rats (compared to CD-fed rats) showed increased mRNA expression of genes involved in the development of AD. In contrast, the TG HFD-fed female group, showed a higher number of upregulated genes compared to their respective CD-fed TG group. In TG HFD-fed rats there was higher mRNA expression of genes crucial for synaptic transmission such as Brain-derived neurotrophic factor in females and Choline acetyltransferase in males. Expression of Plasminogen was higher in HFD-fed TG female rats and HFD-fed WT male rats. Overall, the HFD-fed WT male showed mRNA expression of genes involved in the development of AD. However, HFD-fed TG females were more vulnerable for the progression of AD. It is likely that the enteric Plasminogen plays a major role in gut-brain axis for the development of AD in WT male, and progression of AD in TG female during the consumption of HFD.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The consumption of HFD perturbed the expression of enteric genes known to be involved in amyloid-β generation, clearance, and degradation, in a sex-dependent manner.",

        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: A higher diet-dependent acid-base load has been associated with low grade inflammation and selected medical conditions. No study has examined the association between diet-dependent acid-base load and progression or inflammatory activity measures in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nMETHODS: A prospective cohort, aged 18-59 years at study entry, was followed annually for ten years as part of the AusLong Study. At study entry, participants (n = 223) received a first clinical diagnosis of central nervous system demyelination. Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL) and Net Endogenous Acid Production (NEAP) were calculated using dietary intake data (previous 12 months) from a food frequency questionnaire measured at the baseline 5- and 10-year AusLong reviews. We examined the association between PRAL and NEAP with measures of MS progression and inflammatory activity, including time to relapse, annualised disability change (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesion volume, and black hole lesion volume (ml).\n\nRESULTS: We observed no association between PRAL or NEAP with the rate of relapse in the continuous form (p = 0.35). When examining the PRAL and NEAP as categorical variables, the highest PRAL quartile, but not the NEAP, was associated with a lower risk of relapse rather than a higher risk, as hypothesised (Q4 vs Q1: adjusted Hazard Ratio=0.26, 95 %CI=0.10, 0,65, p = 0.004; p for trend 0.06). There was no significant association between PRAL or NEAP, either using the continuous form or when assessed as categorical variables, with annualised EDSS change, FLAIR lesion volume, or black hole lesion volume in any region.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that a higher diet-dependent acid-base load is not associated with a worsening in MS progression and measured inflammatory activity measures.",

        "Abstract": "The brain contains approximately 100 billion neurons and over 200 billion glial cells, which are integral to the neuronal networks that support normal brain function in the central nervous system. The complexity of the brain makes the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease particularly challenging. Neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia. Dementia refers to a decline in memory and thinking ability, affecting approximately 55 million people worldwide. Owing to the association of multiple factors, including amyloid-β plaque, tau-fibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, nutritional defects, and genetic mutations, the exact cause of the most common type of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, remains elusive. These multiple factors may cause damage to neurons and glial cells, leading to neurodegeneration. Very few therapeutics are available for neurodegenerative diseases due to the limited understanding of their pathogenesis, resulting in the lack of biomarkers and drug targets. Recent attention has shifted toward addressing modifiable risk factors such as unhealthy diets and lifestyles to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Unhealthy diets that consist of saturated fatty acids and refined sugars, with other multiple risk factors, increase neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, furthering cognitive decline and progression of neurodegeneration. Mitigating these risk factors with antioxidants, anti-inflammatory-based nutrition, and multidomain lifestyle intervention, which may include physical exercise, cognitive stimulation, and social engagement, may delay the development of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. In this review, we focus on the role of neuroinflammation in contributing to neurodegeneration and dietary influence in Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Abstract": "Background: There are many pharmacological treatment options beyond levodopa for Parkinson's disease (PD), with a variety of drug classes and formulations available. To achieve patient-centered care, clinicians must consider patients' backgrounds and preferences when selecting medications. Objectives: To investigate medication preferences regarding efficacy, safety, dosage/formulation, and cost in Japanese PD patients. Methods: Adults (18-90 years) from the Japan Parkinson's Disease Association receiving PD medication were eligible. An online survey was conducted, involving a discrete choice experiment, which set five medication characteristics including improvement of bothersome symptoms, risk of dyskinesia, risk of side effects other than dyskinesia, dosage/formulation, and monthly out-of-pocket cost. A questionnaire about the value of efficacy and safety of PD medications was also included. Results: In the full analysis set (N = 207), the mean age was 65.2 years, 53.1% were female, and 62.8% had wearing-off. The most impotrant characteristics of PD medications for patients were the risk of dyskinesia, improvement of bothersome symptoms, and risk of side effects other than dyskinesia. Latent class analysis identified three groups with different preferences who have varied backgrounds, such as disease severity. The three most important symptoms patients wanted to improve were moving difficulty/slow movement (79.7%), body stiffness (43.5%), and pain (42.0%). The three most important side effects patients wanted to avoid were dyskinesia (54.6%), hallucinations/visual hallucinations (19.3%), and constipation (11.6%). Conclusion: PD patients placed the highest importance on the risk of dyskinesia for PD medications and also efficacy. To achieve patient-centered care, clinicians should consider patients' backgrounds and preferences when selecting medications.",

        "Abstract": "Precision medicine driven by clinical biomarkers is the state-of-art management approach for Parkinson's disease (PD). Whether pattern of striatal dopaminergic deficiency (demonstrated by single-photon emission CT (SPECT) scanning with 123I-Ioflupane, DaTSCAN) could be a biomarker predicting levodopa requirement in early PD is not known. Participants with early PD (disease duration (DD) ≤ 5 years, Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) ≤ 3) who underwent DaTSCAN as a part of clinical-diagnostic work up and were enrolled in the \"Non-motor Longitudinal International Study\" (UK National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network Number 10084) were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Specific DaTSCAN binding ratios were analyzed for each striatum, caudate nucleus and putamen and the z-scores were derived normalizing the images to age and gender-matched healthy controls from the European-Database-of-DaTSCAN-of-healthy-controls (ENC-DAT). Using linear regression analysis, we explored the impact of DaT-uptake z-scores for more severely affected putamen, caudate nucleus and striatum on the LEDD. Statistically significant predictors identified in the univariable analysis were included in the multivariable analysis with DD and H&Y as additional independent variables. 43 PwP (30% female; age: 61.91 ± 11.45years; DD: 2(0-5) years; H&Y: 2(1-3); LEDD: 424.27 ± 342.62 mg) were assessed 19.12 ± 13.11 months following the DaTSCAN. In a multivariable linear regression analysis, when adjusted for DD and H&Y, z-caudate nucleus (B=-134.073, 95% CI -262.715 - -5.431, p = 0.042) and z-striatum (B=-162.137, 95% CI -306.306 - -17.967, p = 0.028), were statistically significant predictors of LEDD, while z-putamen was not (p = 0.086). In early PD, striatal DaT-uptake z-scores may serve as biomarkers that could aid the LEDD estimation and guide treatment decisions towards personalized care.",

        "Abstract": "AimMeningeal nociceptors within the trigeminal ganglion are important contributors to migraine pathogenesis because they transmit pain signals from the dura mater to the central nervous system. As such, pharmacological interventions that target these peripheral neurons might offer new avenues for migraine treatment. In this context, ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels have garnered increasing attention as potential modulators of meningeal nociception. Human experimental studies support this hypothesis, showing that intravenous infusion of levcromakalim, a KATP channel opener, induces migraine attacks in people with migraine and mild, transient headache in healthy adults. However, the precise anatomical site and mechanism of action remain incompletely understood.MethodsTo address these gaps, we conducted in vivo single-unit electrophysiological recordings of 36 meningeal nociceptors (23 Aδ- and 13 C-fibers) in the trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized male and female rats. We measured spontaneous firing rates before and up to four hours after a 20-minute continuous intracarotid infusion of levcromakalim (1.43 mg/kg or 0.14 mg/kg) or vehicle (71.4% ethanol).ResultsLevcromakalim at 1.43 mg/kg activated nine (69%) of 13 nociceptors, compared with one (11%) of nine in the vehicle group (p = 0.012). Activation rates did not differ between Aδ-fibers (6 of 8, 69%) and C-fibers (3 of 6; 50%; p = 1.00), or between male (6 of 8; 75%) and female animals (3 of 5; 60%; p = 0.61). Moreover, levcromakalim at 0.14 mg/kg activated only three (21%) of 14 nociceptors.ConclusionsTaken together, our findings demonstrate that KATP channel opening mediates activation of meningeal nociceptors, providing a mechanistic basis for previous observations in humans. The development of KATP channel blockers might therefore hold therapeutic promise for migraine by inhibiting meningeal nociceptors.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive symptoms are highly prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD), often manifesting as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Yet, their detection and characterization remain suboptimal because standard approaches rely on subjective impressions derived from lengthy, univariate tests.\n\nOBJECTIVE: We examined whether digital analysis of verbal fluency predicts cognitive status in PD.\n\nMETHODS: We asked 464 Spanish speakers with PD to complete taxonomic (animal), thematic (supermarket), and phonemic (/p/) fluency tasks. We quantified six response properties: semantic variability, granularity, concreteness, length, frequency, and phonological neighborhood. In Study 1, these properties were fed to a ridge regressor to predict Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) scores and subscores. In Study 2, we used the same properties to compare (via a generalized linear model) and classify (via random forest) between 123 patients with and 124 without MCI.\n\nRESULTS: In Study 1, predicted MDRS scores and subscores strongly correlated with actual ones, adjusting for clinical and cognitive variables (R = 0.51, P < 0.001). In Study 2, MCI patients' words were less semantically variable, less concrete, and shorter, adjusting for clinical and cognitive variables (P-values < 0.05). Machine learning discrimination between patients with and without MCI was robust in the validation set (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.76), with good generalization to unseen pre-surgical (AUC = 0.68) and post-surgical (AUC = 0.72) samples, surpassing MDRS scores (AUC = 0.54). Results were consistently driven by semantic variability, granularity, and concreteness.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Digital word property analysis predicts cognitive symptom severity and distinguishes between cognitive phenotypes of PD, enabling scalable neuropsychological screenings. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

Early life has not been comprehensively tested for potential risk factors for dementia.ObjectiveTo explore the associations between childhood conditions and exposures and cognitive impairment in adulthood.MethodsIn the US Health and Retirement Study (normal baseline cognition; n = 16,509; 2008-2018 waves), 31 exposures before age 16 were retrospectively assessed with ten-year incident cognitive status (dementia, impaired, normal). Using parallel modified Poisson models, each exposure was tested with incident cognition, adjusting for sex, baseline age, follow-up, race/ethnicity, personal/parental education.ResultsAmong the analytic sample, participants were mean 61 years of age at baseline and all had normal cognition. During up to 10 years of follow-up, 14.5% developed cognitive impairment and 5.3% developed dementia. Participants with depression during childhood had 1.49 (95%CI:1.2,1.84) times higher risk of incident impairment, relative to normal cognition. Participants with headaches/migraines during childhood had 1.43 (95%CI:1.14,1.79) times higher risk of incidence of dementia. Participants with learning problems during childhood had 1.71 (95%CI:1.44,2.03) times higher risk of incident impairment. Childhood self-rated health of fair (1.59, 95%CI:1.2,2.1) and poor (2.42, 95%CI:1.62,3.61) had higher risk of incidence of dementia, relative to excellent self-rated health. Associations between additional exposures and either incident impairment or dementia did not reach the multiple testing threshold (false discovery rate < 0.01).ConclusionsConditions and exposures during the early life period may be important for later life cognitive impairment or dementia.

Traditional survival models often fail to capture complex longitudinal biomarker patterns associated with disease progression.ObjectiveWe propose an ensemble survival analysis framework integrating multiple survival models to improve early prediction of clinical progression in initially cognitively normal individuals.MethodsWe analyzed longitudinal biomarker data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, including 721 participants, limiting analysis to up to three visits (baseline, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up). Of these, 142 (19.7%) experienced clinical progression to MCI or AD. Our approach combined penalized Cox regression (LASSO, Elastic Net) with advanced survival models (Random Survival Forest, DeepSurv, XGBoost). Model predictions were aggregated using ensemble averaging and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). Predictive performance was assessed using Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and time-dependent area under the curve (AUC).ResultsThe ensemble model achieved a peak C-index of 0.907 and an integrated time dependent AUC of 0.904, outperforming baseline-only models (C-index 0.608). One follow-up visit after baseline significantly improved prediction accuracy (48.1% C-index, 48.2% AUC gains), while adding a second follow-up provided only marginal gains (2.1% C-index, 2.7% AUC).ConclusionsOur ensemble survival framework effectively integrates diverse survival models and aggregation techniques to enhance early prediction of preclinical AD progression. These findings highlight the importance of leveraging longitudinal biomarker data, particularly one follow-up visit, for accurate risk stratification and personalized intervention strategies.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common degenerative dementia, but no studies investigate bereaved caregiver experiences.ObjectiveTo investigate the experiences of caregivers three months after the death of persons with DLB using a mixed-methods approach.MethodsDyads of individuals with moderate-advanced DLB and their primary informal caregivers were followed prospectively every 6 months until the person with DLB died. Caregivers completed a study visit with questionnaires and a semi-structured interview ∼3 months later. Spearman correlation coefficients and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests evaluated the relationships of post-death measures with pre-death patient and caregiver variables. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the interviews.ResultsSeventy-three caregivers completed visits (mean 3.5 months post-death). Most of the caregivers were women (82.2%) and spouses (76.7%) or adult children (17.8%). Over 40% had scores indicating risk for clinical depression. Post-death caregiver experiences (depression, quality of life, grief, resilience) correlated with pre-death caregiver experiences. Post-death experiences did not associate with patient characteristics, disease-related symptoms, or healthcare services used in the last 6 months of life. Trajectories for caregiver measures from pre- to post-death visits varied widely. Interview themes included grief and sadness, anger, guilt and regret, relief, appreciation/gratitude, and adjusting to a new normal.ConclusionsThe finding that pre-death caregiving experiences have the strongest association with post-death experiences emphasizes the critical importance of accessible and evidence-based caregiver support before and after the death of a person with DLB.

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and stress hyperglycemia (quantified as fasting plasma glucose/glycosylated hemoglobin ratio, GAR) are strongly associated with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) progression and adverse clinical outcomes. However, the relationship between the TyG index, GAR, and early neurological deterioration (END) in isolated acute pontine infarction (IAPI) patients remained undefined. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of the TyG index and GAR for END in patients with IAPI.\n\nMETHODS: This study enrolled 192 patients diagnosed with IAPI at Jiangsu Province (Suqian) Hospital between March 2022 and June 2024. Patients were stratified into END and non-END groups based on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) criteria. Clinical data and hematological indicators of the two groups were collected, and the TyG index and GAR were calculated. Risk factors for END were analyzed by multifactorial logistic regression. The diagnostic value of the risk factors was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.\n\nRESULTS: Among 192 participants, 53 (27.6%) developed END. Significant intergroup differences were observed in baseline NIHSS scores, IAPI etiological subtypes, TG, LDL-C, FPG, TyG index, and GAR (all p < 0.05). The TyG index and GAR were risk factors for END by multivariate logistic analysis (all p < 0.05). ROC analysis revealed AUC values of 0.769 (95% CI: 0.657-0.841, p < 0.001) for the TyG index and 0.752 (95% CI: 0.632-0.826, p < 0.001) for GAR in predicting END. The optimal cut-off values were 8.52 and 18.72. The area under the curve of the combined prediction END of the TyG index and GAR was 0.839 (95% CI: 0.728-0.882, p < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION: Elevated TyG index and GAR serve as independent risk factors for END in IAPI patients, demonstrating significant diagnostic potential as combined biomarkers.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The clinical utility of dementia prognostic scores has limited validity across diverse populations. This study aimed to enhance the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) model by incorporating resting heart rate (RHR) using a machine learning method across a diverse population.\n\nMETHODS: We developed CAIDE and CAIDE-RHR models using a random forest algorithm in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset. Model performances were assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and the Brier score.\n\nRESULTS: Incorporating RHR into the CAIDE model significantly improved predictive accuracy across Black African, Asian, White, and Native Hawaiian populations (mean AUC range: 0.80-0.91). However, this improvement was not observed in the American Indian population, where the AUC decreased from 0.87 to 0.84.\n\nDISCUSSION: Our findings highlight significant ethnic differences in dementia risk prediction models. These results underscore the need for validating and tailoring dementia risk scores to ensure applicability across diverse races.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: Incorporating resting heart rate (RHR) into the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE) model significantly improves its predictive accuracy for dementia risk across diverse populations, offering a novel addition to dementia risk models. The application of the machine learning technique enhances dementia risk prediction by capturing complex, non-linear relationships among variables. The improved model enables more precise early identification of individuals at risk of cognitive decline, supporting preventive strategies in dementia care. Resting heart rate, a simple and non-invasive cardiovascular measure, is demonstrated to be a valuable predictor for dementia risk, making it practical for clinical application.",

        "Abstract": "BackgroundFreezing of gait (FOG) is a common and disabling symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), significantly impairing motor function and quality of life. While traditional deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) provides some benefits, its efficacy in alleviating FOG remains limited. Combined stimulation of the STN and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) has recently emerged as a potentially superior approach.ObjectiveTo compare the efficacy of STN-only stimulation and combined STN + SNr stimulation in improving FOG symptoms and quality of life in patients with PD.MethodsThis multicenter, prospective, randomized, crossover study was conducted between May 2020 and May 2024 and enrolled patients with PD and significant FOG. All participants received bilateral DBS electrode implantation. Each subject sequentially underwent both STN-only and combined STN + SNr stimulation conditions according to a randomized crossover schedule, with each stimulation period lasting for six months. Outcome assessments, including the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG-Q) and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire Summary Index (PDQ-SI), were conducted at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Data were analyzed using mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance, followed by post hoc Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons to account for the crossover design.ResultsCompared to STN-only stimulation, combined STN + SNr stimulation resulted in significantly greater improvement in FOG-Q scores and PDQ-SI scores. The benefits were observed at each assessment following the switch to combined stimulation.ConclusionsCombined STN and SNr stimulation was more effective than STN-only stimulation in alleviating FOG symptoms and improving quality of life in patients with PD. This dual-target DBS approach may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for managing refractory FOG in PD.",

In the training set (n = 289; 28% pBlack), we used receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to calculate two cut points (0.95 sensitivity and specificity) to detect amyloid PET positivity. Cut points were validated in an independent test set (n = 846; 12% pBlack).\n\nRESULTS: In the test set, plasma p-tau217/Aβ42 had the highest accuracy (pBlack: 0.88, pWhite: 0.91) and lowest proportion of intermediate classifications (≤0.16), with no classification difference by race (odds ratio [OR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66-2.95, p = 0.33).

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, leading to the formation of neurotoxic soluble oligomers (AβOs) that impair calcium homeostasis in neurons and astrocytes. Aducanumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting aggregated Aβ, has been approved for AD treatment due to its ability to reduce amyloid plaque burden. However, its specificity toward different AβO species and its functional impact on calcium homeostasis remain unclear.\n\nMETHODS: We investigated aducanumab's ability to recognize and immunodeplete low-molecular-weight (LMW) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) AβOs using three Aβ preparations: (1) transgenic conditioned media (TgCM) from cultured Tg2576 neurons, (2) synthetic Aβ42-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), and (3) TBS-soluble fractions from aged Tg2576 mouse brain. Size exclusion chromatography and ELISA were used to characterize AβO species. Multiphoton calcium imaging of neuron-astrocyte co-cultures was performed to assess the impact of aducanumab on AβO-induced calcium overload.\n\nRESULTS: Aducanumab preferentially bound and immunodepleted HMW AβOs in ADDLs and the TBS-soluble fraction of Tg2576 mouse brain extracts but did not recognize LMW AβOs in TgCM. In calcium imaging experiments, all three AβO preparations induced calcium overload in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures. Immunodepletion with aducanumab prevented calcium overload in cultures exposed to ADDLs and Tg2576 brain extracts but not in those treated with immunodepleted TgCM, indicating that aducanumab selectively neutralizes HMW AβOs.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that aducanumab specifically targets HMW AβOs, mitigating their neurotoxic effects by restoring intracellular calcium homeostasis. These results provide mechanistic insight into aducanumab's therapeutic action and support its potential role in modifying AD pathology by selectively neutralizing Aβ species.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Migraine is one of the most disabling conditions affecting the quality of life in society. The pathophysiology of migraine is not yet fully understood, but neuroinflammation is thought to play an important role. The aim of our study is to investigate the potential biomarker properties of adipokines and cytokines in migraine and to assess their relationship with clinical features, including headache frequency, severity, disability scores.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included a total of 90 participants: 30 with episodic migraines (EM), 30 with chronic migraines(CM), and 30 healthy volunteers, all aged between 18 and 50 years. Data were collected on patients age, sex, migraine characteristics (pain location, type), attack frequency over the past 3 months, duration of the disease, attack severity, and body mass index. During the interictal period, blood levels of high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin, leptin, resistin, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β were measured using ELISA kits.\n\nRESULTS: The age, sex, and body mass index between the patient and control groups were similar. Levels of HMW-adiponectin, resistin, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β were significantly higher in the patient group compared to the control group (p < 0.001 for each). HMW-adiponectin and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in CM patients compared to the EM group (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). Additionally, adiponectin and IL-6 levels were positively correlated with the number of painful days, and IL-6 and leptin levels correlated with MIDAS scores.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The higher levels of cytokines and adipokines, in migraine patients compared to the control group suggest a potential role of neuroinflammation in migraine pathophysiology. The elevated levels of HMW-adiponectin and IL-6 in CM patients indicate that these molecules may be associated with the mechanisms involved in the chronification of migraine and pain burden.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles, leading to neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline. Despite extensive research, current therapies for AD show limited efficacy. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive therapeutic approach due to its neuroprotective and immunomodulatory properties. This study investigates the effects of LIPUS on Aβ pathology, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits in a transgenic AD mouse model. Twelve-month-old J20 transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) were used to model middle-to-late-stage AD. LIPUS was administered for 30 days, targeting the bilateral hippocampus. Spatial memory was assessed via the Morris water maze (MWM). Aβ plaque burden and synaptic integrity were quantified using immunofluorescence and Thioflavin-S staining. Western blot analysis evaluated neurotrophic factors, inflammatory markers, and synaptic proteins (PSD95). LIPUS treatment significantly improved spatial learning and memory deficits in APP transgenic mice, as evidenced by reduced escape latency and increased platform crossings in the MWM test. LIPUS significantly reduced hippocampal amyloid plaque burden and promoted microglial recruitment to Aβ plaques. Importantly, LIPUS downregulated TNF-α expression without affecting IL-6 levels, suggesting enhanced Aβ clearance without inducing neuroinflammation. Furthermore, LIPUS increased synaptophysin expression in the CA3-mossy fiber and dentate gyrus (DG) regions, while PSD95 levels remained unchanged. Our findings demonstrate that LIPUS enhances microglial-mediated Aβ clearance, preserves synaptic integrity, and improves cognitive function in a transgenic AD model. As a non-invasive modality capable of targeting deep brain structures, LIPUS holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.",

Change in dyskinesia was assessed by LCIG treatment group (monotherapy, daytime monotherapy, polytherapy), baseline dyskinesia duration (<4 vs. ≥4 hours), and dyskinesia severity (troublesome vs. non-troublesome). Correlations between changes in dyskinesia and patient-reported outcomes (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 [PDQ-8], Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale-2 [PDSS-2], non-motor symptoms scale [NMSS]) were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale IV measured dyskinesia duration (Item 32), severity (Item 33), and pain (Item 34). Data were collected cross-sectionally at a single study visit.\n\nRESULTS: Over 50% (202/369) of LCIG-treated patients experienced improvement in dyskinesia severity. Improvements in dyskinesia duration and severity were noted in all treatment groups. The proportion of patients with troublesome dyskinesia and amount of \"Off\" time significantly decreased from baseline to study visit, regardless of baseline dyskinesia burden (P < 0.01); dyskinesia duration improved only in the ≥4-hour subgroup (P < 0.01). In the ≥4-hour subgroup, dyskinesia duration correlated positively with PDQ-8; dyskinesia severity correlated positively with PDQ-8 and PDSS-2; and dyskinesia pain correlated positively with PDQ-8, PDSS-2, and NMSS.\n\nCONCLUSION: LCIG led to reductions in dyskinesia severity, regardless of baseline dyskinesia burden.

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The hypothalamus is a versatile structure comprising several nuclei that play key roles in regulating various biological processes associated with migraine, including hormone secretion, metabolism, circadian rhythm, and autonomic nervous system functions. However, the involvement of hypothalamic subregions in migraine remains unclear.\n\nMETHODS: Based on T1-weighted MRI data from 76 migraine patients (23 episodic migraine [EM], 53 chronic migraine [CM]) and 35 healthy controls (HCs), we examined group differences in the volume of five hypothalamic subregions. To clarify causal relationships between migraine and hypothalamic volume, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Mediation analysis was further performed to assess the role of gut microbiota composition in this association.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to HCs, migraine patients exhibited significantly reduced total hypothalamic volume (813.53 ± 66.46 mm³ vs. 831.86 ± 57.91 mm³; FDR q = 0.048) and inferior tuberal hypothalamic volume (255.26 ± 30.17 mm³ vs. 265.29 ± 23.32 mm³; FDR q = 0.046). These reductions were particularly pronounced in patients with CM, whereas no significant differences were observed in those with EM. MR analysis revealed causal effects of total hypothalamic volumes (OR = 0.80, FDR q = 7.28 × 10-5) and inferior tuberal hypothalamic volumes (OR = 0.85, FDR q = 2.61 × 10-2) on migraine, providing causal evidence to support the observational findings from the cross-sectional study. Furthermore, specific gut microbiome (genus DefluviitaleaceaeUCG011, genus Eubacteriumruminantiumgroup, and family FamilyXIII) were identified as partial mediators of the hypothalamus-migraine link (FDR q < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that atrophy of the inferior tuberal subregion of the hypothalamus plays a pivotal role in increasing migraine risk, and that this effect is partially mediated through alterations in gut microbiome composition.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders affecting the eye and the brain, respectively. Despite targeting different organs, they share common molecular mechanisms. A central process connecting these conditions is the unfolded protein response (UPR), which maintains protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Dysregulation of UPR pathways, particularly the IRE1-XBP1 and PERK-eIF2α pathways, can lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. While the IRE1-XBP1 pathway regulates protein folding and inflammatory signaling, the PERK-eIF2α pathway reduces protein synthesis but may trigger apoptosis if persistently activated. Emerging therapies targeting UPR pathways and ER chaperones show promise in mitigating neurodegenerative damage in DR and AD. This review highlights shared pathophysiological mechanisms, explore retinal biomarkers for early AD detection, and emphasizes UPR modulation as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegeneration in aging-related diseases. HIGHLIGHTS: Diabetic retinopathy (DR, ocular disorder) and Alzheimer's disease (AD, cerebral disorder) share common molecular mechanisms, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and proteostasis dysfunction. UPR is a critical pathway linking both diseases through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and neurodegeneration and targeting unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways, ER chaperones (e.g., P58IPK), and anti-inflammatory treatments show promise. The IRE1-XBP1 pathway regulates protein homeostasis and inflammation; XBP1s protects against ER stress in both retinal and brain neurons. The PERK-eIF2α pathway suppresses protein synthesis under stress but may induce apoptosis via ATF4 and CHOP if chronically activated. Age-related decline in metabolism, proteostasis, and neurovascular function intensifies disease progression and exacerbates molecular and cellular damage in both DR and AD.",

This study explored whether and how chronic migraine affects cortical activity patterns at single-cell resolution in the primary visual cortex during its progression.\n\nMETHODS: Longitudinal in vivo two-photon calcium imaging was performed in the primary visual cortex of a chronic migraine mouse model across multiple time points. Cortical circuit activity patterns and behavioral correlates were assessed through combined chemogenetic manipulation and pharmacological interventions, with a particular focus on primary visual cortex functional modulation.\n\nRESULTS: Following chronic migraine induction, spontaneous hyperactivation emerged in cortical activity patterns within the primary visual cortex. Layer II/III neurons appeared as major contributors to this neural dysregulation, with layer V neurons showing less pronounced involvement. Prophylactic topiramate treatment attenuated allodynia and light aversion behaviors while reducing pathological cortical hyperactivity. Chemogenetic inhibition of primary visual cortex layer II/III neurons ameliorated light aversion without attenuating pain sensitization, while modulating aberrant spontaneous cortical activity patterns.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary evidence for dynamic alterations in spontaneous cortical neural signatures within the primary visual cortex throughout chronic migraine progression. Modulation of these neural adaptations appears to show the potential to alleviate associated light sensitivity, providing insight into potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying light sensitivity in chronic migraine.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis (MG), an IgG-mediated autoimmune disorder targeting neuromuscular junctions, shows refractory in 12-20% of generalised MG (gMG) patients despite immunotherapies. Plasma exchange (PLEX) transiently depletes pathogenic mediators, while neonatal Fc receptor antagonists (eg, efgartigimod) offer novel therapeutic potential. Both PLEX and efgartigimod require adjunctive non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapy (NSIST) for sustained remission. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of efgartigimod working as a bridge treatment after PLEX but before NSIST taking effect, while concurrently conducting a comparative analysis of clinical outcomes between PLEX and efgartigimod in gMG.\n\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre, open-label, three-arm trial (n=45 gMG patients) assigns cohorts to PLEX+efgartigimod, PLEX alone or efgartigimod alone. The intervention comprises PLEX and/or efgartigimod. Oral glucocorticoids and cholinesterase inhibitors are allowed during this study. NSIST starts the day after completing PLEX or the second dose of efgartigimod. Outcomes are assessed at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36 and 48. Primary endpoint: proportion achieving minimal symptom expression (MSE) at week 48. Secondary endpoints: median time to first MSE, adverse events (AE) incidence/severity, exacerbation rates, neurological functional assessment scores, cholinesterase inhibitor/corticosteroid usage, serological evolution of immunological markers. All AEs are systematically documented and causality-assessed.\n\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical clearance for this investigation was granted by the Institutional Review Board of Punan Hospital in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki principles.

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global challenge, representing the most common neurodegenerative disorder and affecting millions of lives. As life expectancy continues to rise and populations expand, the number of individuals coping with the cognitive declines caused by AD is projected to double in the coming years. By 2050, we may see over 115 million people diagnosed with this devastating condition. Unfortunately, while we currently lack effective cures, there are preventative measures that can slow disease progression in symptomatic patients. Thus, research has shifted toward early detection and intervention for AD in recent years. With technological advances, we are now harnessing large datasets and more efficient, minimally invasive methods for diagnosis and treatment. This review highlights critical demographic insights, health conditions that increase the risk of developing AD, and lifestyle factors in midlife that can potentially trigger its onset. Additionally, we delve into the promising role of plant-based metabolites and their sources, which may help delay the disease's progression. The innovative multi-omics research is transforming our understanding of AD. This approach enables comprehensive data analysis from diverse cell types and biological processes, offering possible biomarkers of this disease's mechanisms. We present the latest advancements in genomics, transcriptomics, Epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, including significant progress in gene editing technologies. When combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence, multi-omics analysis becomes a powerful tool for uncovering the complexities of AD pathogenesis. We also explore current trends in the application of radiomics and machine learning, emphasizing how integrating multi-omics data can transform our approach to AD research and treatment. Together, these pioneering advancements promise to develop more effective preventive and therapeutic strategies soon.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: A pathogenic variant in the NOTCH3 gene has been identified as the cause of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Studies focusing on variants in NOTCH3 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cohorts have been limited. We aim to screen clinically diagnosed AD and FTD patients with unknown etiology for pathogenic variants in NOTCH3 in the Chinese population.\n\nMETHODS: This study included early-onset AD and FTD patients consecutively recruited from Xuanwu Hospital. We performed the whole exome sequencing of genomic DNA from the patients screened for rare, nonsynonymous, predicted deleterious NOTCH3 variants. The clinical characteristics of dementia patients with likely pathogenic NOTCH3 variants were described in detail.\n\nRESULTS: Three hundred four AD and 261 FTD patients were screened for variants in the NOTCH3 gene. Four cysteine-altering NOTCH3 variants-c.1630C > T,p.(R544C); c.1672C > T,p.(R558C); c.1759C > T,p.(R587C); and c.1918C > T,p.(R640C)-were identified as likely pathogenic variants according to ACMG guidelines. All four patients with cysteine-altering variants were clinically diagnosed with AD or FTD and presented with characteristic clinical manifestations and neuroimaging profiles. Notably, they also showed mild periventricular and deep white matter signal changes on neuroimaging. Our study showed a 0.7% (4/565) occurrence of NOTCH3 pathogenic variants in Chinese early-onset dementia patients.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings expand the mutational and phenotypic spectrum associated with NOTCH3. NOTCH3 pathogenic variants are present in clinically diagnosed AD and FTD patients. However, the absence of biomarkers to confirm AD or FTD diagnoses limits the interpretation of whether these cases represent comorbid conditions or phenotypic overlaps with CADASIL. Clinical identification of dementia patients with these variants at an early stage is challenging.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic migraine (CM) is a leading cause of disability and often linked to medication overuse headache (MOH). Psychological factors, such as pain coping, may contribute to chronification and medication overuse. While behavioral therapy can help, identifying patients who will benefit remains challenging. This study compared pain coping in individuals with CM and MOH to those with episodic migraine (EM) and controls without headache. It also assessed whether baseline pain coping in CM patients could predict withdrawal treatment success.\n\nMETHODS: In patients that received behavioral therapy as part of the Chronification and Reversibility of Migraine clinical trial, patients with CM and MOH were assessed at baseline and after treatment on pain acceptance with the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II for Pain (AAQ-II-P), and with the Pain-catastrophizing scale (PCS) and Headache Specific Locus of Control (HSLC) questionnaires. The non-headache groups were assessed once. In total, 65 CM, 34 EM, and 49 non-headache controls were included.\n\nRESULTS: Patients with CM experienced less pain acceptance compared with EM patients and healthy controls with AAQ-II-P (adjusted mean difference [AMD]: 10.0 [95% CI: 3.7-16.2], p < 0.001 and AMD: 13.9 [95% CI: 7.8-20.1], p < 0.001, respectively) and had higher PCS (AMD: 12.1 [95% CI: 5.2-19.0], p < 0.001, AMD: 17.3 [95% CI: 10.5-24.0], p < 0.001, respectively), but comparable PCS to patients with back pain or depression. Patients with CM were more likely to believe their headaches were due to coincidence compared to EM, HSLC-chance (AMD: 4.0 [95% CI: 0.3-7.7], p = 0.034). Importantly, higher PCS scores were associated with greater reduction in migraine days after treatment (OR: 1.06 [95% CI 1.01-1.11], p = 0.030).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with CM demonstrated poorer pain coping compared to those with EM and healthy controls. High catastrophizing in patients with CM predicts a better response to behavioral withdrawal treatment.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To synthesize and interpret magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) findings on vascular changes after administration of established molecular migraine triggers in adults with migraine and in healthy individuals, focusing on the middle meningeal artery (MMA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA).\n\nMETHODS: A systematic review of experimental studies using MRA to assess extracerebral and intracerebral arterial responses to established molecular migraine triggers was conducted. Eligible studies included adults with migraine or healthy volunteers, use of MRA, and oral ingestion or intravenous infusion of an established molecular migraine trigger. Studies not meeting these criteria, as well as conference abstracts, preprints, reviews, case reports, and case series, were excluded.\n\nRESULTS: Sixteen eligible MRA studies were identified. The triggers used included calcitonin gene-related peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptides (PACAP-27 and PACAP-38), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, nitroglycerin, cilostazol, sildenafil, and levcromakalim. All triggers induced extracerebral (meningeal) arterial dilation, often accompanied by headache or migraine attacks. Dilation induced by neuropeptides was confined to extracerebral arteries, consistent with limited blood-brain barrier penetration. In contrast, nitroglycerin and levcromakalim also dilated cerebral arteries. Across all studies, sumatriptan consistently reversed extracerebral arterial dilation and alleviated migraine pain.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Established molecular triggers reliably induce extracerebral arterial dilation, an effect reversed by sumatriptan. These findings support the hypothesis that sustained meningeal vasodilation might contribute causally to migraine pathogenesis. Standardized MRA protocols, rigorous methodological designs, and well-controlled studies are needed to further refine our understanding of these vascular mechanisms and to guide the development of more targeted therapies for migraine.",

Traditional diagnostic approaches rely heavily on clinical observation and subjective assessment, often leading to delayed or inaccurate diagnoses. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offers unprecedented opportunities for precision diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies in PD management.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to comprehensively review current AI applications in Parkinson's disease diagnosis and treatment, evaluate existing methodologies, and present experimental results from a novel multimodal AI diagnostic framework.\n\nMETHODS: A systematic review was conducted across PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science databases from 2018 to 2024, focusing on AI applications in PD diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, we developed and tested a hybrid machine learning model combining deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing techniques for PD assessment using motor symptom analysis, voice pattern recognition, and gait analysis.\n\nRESULTS: The systematic review identified 127 relevant studies demonstrating significant advances in AI-driven PD diagnosis, with accuracy rates ranging from 78 to 96%. Our experimental framework achieved 94.2% accuracy in early-stage PD detection, outperforming traditional clinical assessment methods. The integrated approach showed particular strength in identifying subtle motor fluctuations and predicting treatment response patterns.\n\nCONCLUSION: AI-driven approaches demonstrate substantial potential for revolutionizing PD diagnosis and treatment personalization. The integration of multiple data modalities and advanced machine learning algorithms enables earlier detection, more accurate monitoring, and optimized therapeutic interventions.

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by brain protein depositions, impaired synaptic transmission, and progressive cognitive decline. This clinical study, conducted at the tertiary memory clinic of Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, evaluates plasma pTau217 (in comparison to other plasma biomarkers) as a non-invasive marker for predicting brain amyloid load and cognitive impairment. Uniquely, it integrates plasma biomarkers with cognitive profiling and amyloid PET to assess diagnostic utility across disease stages in a real-world memory clinic setting. A total of 122 patients underwent extensive clinical examinations, including CSF analysis (used here for clinical diagnosis only), CT/MRI, neuropsychological (NP) testing (n = 80) and blood biomarker measurements. Prior to PET imaging, 74 patients were diagnosed with MCI among other diagnoses (AD, other dementia, no dementia). Following PET, patients were reclassified into diagnostic groups: MCI Aβ- (n = 29), MCI Aβ+ (n = 19), AD (n = 51), other dementias (n = 11). ROC analysis evaluated the ability of plasma biomarkers to predict Aβ-PET positivity. NP test z-scores were reduced into principal components (PCs) using PCA. Plasma pTau217 and pTau217/Aβ42 ratio were elevated in Aβ+ patients compared to MCI Aβ-patients. The ratio distinguished MCI Aβ+ from AD and, together with pTau217, showed the highest predictive value for Aβ positivity in the MCI group among the biomarkers analyzed (AUC 92.8% and 91.4%). Plasma pTau217/Aβ42 ratio was associated with principal component PC2 (\"memory encoding and recall\") in MCI Aβ+ (ρ =0.64, p=0.01) and negatively correlated with RAVL retrieval (PC2) in the same group (ρ =-0.57 and -0.6, p=0.028 and 0.017, respectively). Additionally, pTau217 correlated with the \"Information\" z-score (PC4) in both AD (ρ = -0.50, p = 0.005) and MCI Aβ+ (ρ = 0.53, p = 0.042). Plasma pTau217/Aβ42 might be a valuable predictor of brain amyloid pathology and a potential marker of domain-specific cognitive impairment in AD.",

PDRBD+ and PDRBD- groups underwent 4 visits within 48 months including clinical assessments and structure MRI. We measured GM atrophy cross-sectionally and longitudinally and analyzed their associations with other proposed markers.\n\nRESULTS: At baseline, all groups were comparable and showed no significant difference in GM volume (GMV). The longitudinal GMV analysis (group-by-time interaction) showed that, compared with PDRBD- group, PDRBD+ demonstrated significant GM loss in the medial surface of the frontal lobes and the left temporal lobe. In the comparison at the 48th month, besides the bilateral frontotemporal lobes, the PDRBD+ group showed significant GM atrophy in the bilateral cerebellum. The two groups had no significant differences in the 12th and 24th months. Over time, each PD group showed extensive cortical GM loss and bilateral caudate and putamen atrophy. The altered GMV (interaction effect) was positively associated with the MoCA scores and negatively with SCOPA-AUT. Furthermore, the group-level F-statistic map highlighted spatially distinct differences in the protein metabolism, signal transduction, and autophagy pathways between PDRBD+ and PDRBD- groups.\n\nCONCLUSION: Body-first PD patients show a relatively rapid GMV loss in specific frontotemporal regions (e.g., left middle temporal gyrus) within 6 years following motor symptoms.

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Structural inequity, including structural racism, is linked to stroke measures. Prior work showed that ecosocial models quantifying constituent domains of structural racism are associated with acute ischemic stroke incidence. It remains unclear if such models can further account for the not-yet-fully explained racial disparities in stroke outcomes.\n\nMETHODS: We performed a national, population-based analysis of 71 078 619 Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019 of whom 844 406 had a primary diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. We estimated the odds ratio and 95% CIs of 3 outcomes (inpatient mortality, 30-day mortality, and discharge home) using multilevel logistic models, with data clustered at the county level. County-level data from the US Census Bureau and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act were used to calculate 8 measures of structural racism. These were tested separately and as a summed, normally distributed composite structural racism score for associations with the outcomes, adjusting for sex, age, urban versus other location, and Black versus White race.\n\nRESULTS: For each SD increase in the composite structural racism score, there was a 16% increase in poststroke inpatient mortality for the total population (odds ratio, 1.160 [95% CI, 1.10-1.215]) without a significant interaction with race (P=0.624). Both 30-day all-cause mortality (P=0.035) and odds of discharge home (P=0.023) significantly interacted with race. For each SD increase in the composite score, Black individuals had a 4.5% increased odds of 30-day mortality and a 5.8% decreased odds of being discharged home, whereas White patients had a 6.5% increase in 30-day mortality and a 3.5% decrease in odds of discharge home.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Increasing levels of structural racism, as calculated using validated quantitative measures of an ecosocial model of structural racism, are correlated with increasing poststroke mortality and decreased odds of discharge home, regardless of race.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Migraine, characterized by recurrent attacks, often necessitates a holistic approach for effective management. Treatment strategies aimed at enhancing self-esteem and self-compassion have been shown to reduce pain intensity in patients with chronic pain. This study aimed to investigate self-esteem and self-compassion in individuals with migraine.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicentre, cross-sectional, case-control study included migraine patients evaluated at headache-specialized outpatient clinics across 22 centers in different regions of Turkey. 901 migraine patients and 901 healthy, matched controls were included. Neurologists specializing in headache disorders administered the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Self-Compassion Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Beck Anxiety Inventory to all participants. Data were compiled at a central site and subjected to statistical analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Migraine patients exhibited significantly lower self-esteem scores compared to healthy controls (p = 0.001 for both). Additionally, Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory scores were significantly higher in migraine patients (p = 0.001 for both). Although the mean self-compassion scores of migraine patients and healthy controls were comparable, a significant decline in self-compassion was observed among patients with higher migraine attack frequency.\n\nDISCUSSION: In conclusion, our findings indicate that migraine patients exhibit significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to healthy controls. Self-esteem scores were also found to be lower in the migraine group. Although self-compassion scores were similar between the two groups, a noteworthy decline in self-compassion was observed in patients with higher migraine attack frequency. These results suggest that increased migraine severity may negatively impact patients' emotional resilience, highlighting the potential value of integrating psychological support into migraine management, particularly for those with frequent attacks.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple sclerosis (MS) presents significant challenges due to its inflammatory and degenerative nature, often manifesting in debilitating symptoms such as gait disturbances. Non-invasive stimulation techniques, such as trans-spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS), offer promising avenues for enhancing functional recovery, but evidence on tsDCS effectiveness in neurological disorders remains sparse. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cathodal tsDCS on gait function and fatigue in people with MS (pwMS) compared to sham tsDCS.\n\nMETHODS: Twenty-two pwMS received 6 sessions of 20-minute cathodal tsDCS (n = 11) or sham tsDCS (n = 11) in addition to a physiotherapy program. The primary outcomes were the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25-FW), Timed Up and Go test (TUG), gait speed, and the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12) evaluated before and after treatment. The secondary outcome was fatigue, measured with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS).\n\nRESULTS: Intergroup comparisons showed a significant improvement in the cathodal tsDCS group compared to the sham tsDCS group. Specifically, there was a greater reduction in pre-post values for T25-FW (Median: -4.43; Range: -12.1 to -1.0), MSWS-12 (-16.70; -31.7 to -5.0), TUG (-6.03; -20.8 to -0.7), FSS (-0.30; -2.2 to 0.1), and FIS-Physical (4.00; -13.0 to 0.0). Additionally, walking speed increased significantly (0.15; 0.02 to 0.24) in the cathodal tsDCS group. Moreover, all gait-related outcomes and FSS showed large effect sizes (r > 0.5), indicating a strong intervention effect.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating cathodal tsDCS into a physiotherapy program improved walking function and fatigue in pwMS. Although replication is warranted, these results hold promise for clinical applications, highlighting tsDCS as a potential tool for enhancing motor function and reducing fatigue in pwMS.\n\nVIDEO ABSTRACT AVAILABLE: for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content available at http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A542).",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is heterogeneous and shows complex interconnected pathways at various biological levels. Risk scores contribute greatly to disease prognosis and biomarker discovery but typically represent generic risk factors. However, large-scale multi-omics data can generate individualized risk factors. Filtering these risk factors with brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) could yield key pathologic pathways and vesicular vehicles for treatment delivery.\n\nMETHODS: A list of 460 EV-related genes was curated from brain tissue samples in the ExoCarta database. This list was used to select genes from transcriptomics, proteomics, and DNA methylation data. Significant risk factors included demographic features (age, sex) and genes significant for progression in transcriptomics data. These genes were selected using Cox regression, aided by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and were used to construct three risk models at different omics levels. Gene signatures from the significant risk factors were used as biomarkers for further evaluation, including gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and drug perturbation analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Nine EV-related genes were identified as significant risk factors. All three risk models predicted high/low risk groups with significant separation in Kaplan-Meier analysis. Training the transcriptomics risk models on EV-related genes yielded better AD classification results than using all genes in an independent dataset. GSEA revealed Mitophagy and several other significant pathways related to AD. Four drugs showed therapeutic potential to target the identified risk factors based on Connectivity Map analysis.\n\nCONCLUSION: The proposed risk score model demonstrates a novel approach to AD using EV-related large-scale multi-omics data. Potential biomarkers and pathways related to AD were identified for further investigation. Drug candidates were identified for further evaluation in biological experiments, potentially transported to targeted tissues via bioengineered EVs.",

        "Abstract": "The Recruitment and Retention for Alzheimer's Disease Diversity in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (READD-ADSP) aims to recruit 5000 African participants (Alzheimer's disease [AD] and cognitively unimpaired controls) to generate genomic and biomarker data to better characterize AD neurobiology in Africa from countries that constitute the African Dementia Consortium (AfDC). Blood samples from study participants are separated into fractions and transported to the African Coordinating Centre (ACC: Ibadan, Nigeria), where DNA extraction and long-term biospecimen storage are carried out. Plasma and DNA aliquots are shipped to the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, University of Miami (HIHG-UM, Miami, USA) for genotyping, whole genome sequencing, and biomarker analysis. Innovative solutions were devised to mitigate challenges encountered so far. Our biobanking experience in a low-resource setting demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a successful African biobanking network, as an important infrastructure to support Alzheimer's disease and related dementias research in Africa. HIGHLIGHTS: Biobanking is gaining grounds in Africa in studies related to neurological disorders. The Recruitment and Retention for Alzheimer's Disease Diversity in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (READD-ADSP) biobanking network is a new initiative to enhance infrastructure for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research in Africa through the African Dementia Consortium. The processes of the stepwise creation and development of the READD-ADSP biobanking network have been guided by global best practices and regulatory standards. Challenges were encountered in the process of establishing the READD-ADSP biobank, and home-grown solutions were developed to mitigate the challenges. The READD-ADSP biobanking experience offers lessons to researchers in low-resource settings on how collaborative efforts between the global north and global south enhance cutting-edge team science to tackle ageing-associated brain disorders in low- and middle-income countries.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Impaired glymphatic clearance may contribute to pathological accumulations in Parkinson's (PD), but how it interacts with other processes causing dementia remains unclear. Diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) has been proposed as an indirect proxy for glymphatic clearance.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To clarify DTI-ALPS' relationship with cognition in PD, and its relationship with established imaging markers.\n\nMETHODS: We assessed DTI-ALPS in 98 PD patients (31 PD poor outcomes: dementia, mild cognitive impairment, frailty, or death within a 3-year follow-up; 67 PD good outcomes) and 28 controls. We assessed DTI-ALPS' relationship to cognition, white matter (fiber cross-section), cortical thickness, iron accumulation (quantitative susceptibility mapping [QSM]), and plasma markers [phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181 and neurofilament light (NfL)] cross-sectionally and longitudinally).\n\nRESULTS: DTI-ALPS was lower in PD-poor outcomes compared with PD good outcomes and controls (P = 0.005) with further longitudinal reductions only in PD poor outcomes (group × time interaction: β = -0.013, P = 0.021). Lower DTI-ALPS was associated with lower fiber cross-section in PD, at baseline and longitudinally but with different spatial distribution from white matter changes relating to PD cognition. There was no correlation between baseline DTI-ALPS and plasma p-tau181 (P = 0.642), NFL (P = 0.448), or baseline cortical thickness. Lower DTI-ALPS was associated with accelerated cortical thinning within left precentral gyrus and changes in brain iron distribution.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: PD patients who develop poor outcomes show lower DTI-ALPS, potentially reflecting impaired glymphatic clearance. DTI-ALPS correlated with white matter integrity and brain iron accumulation. However, both showed different spatial distribution than that seen in PD dementia, suggesting DTI-ALPS captures a distinct contribution to cognitive decline. © 2025 The Author(s).

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Develop a multimodal biomarker framework integrating DTI-ALPS (Diffusion Tensor Imaging along the Perivascular Space), hippocampal diffusivity, and CSF profiles for staging Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression across the HC → MCI → AD continuum.\n\nMETHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 60 age-matched participants [18 healthy controls (HC), 20 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 22 with Alzheimer's disease (AD)] combining 3 T MRI-derived biomarkers (bilateral hippocampal fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), and DTI-ALPS). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (Aβ42, p-tau181, t-tau), and cognitive assessments (MMSE, MoCA). Statistical analyses included ANOVA with Bonferroni correction, Pearson correlations, and ROC curve evaluation for disease classification.\n\nRESULTS: DTI-ALPS exhibited a progressive decline (HC: 1.31 ± 0.12 → MCI: 1.26 ± 0.09 → AD: 0.87 ± 0.19; p < 0.001 for AD vs. HC/MCI). Bilateral FA reductions plateaued in MCI (left: 0.57 ± 0.11 vs. HC: 0.82 ± 0.07, p < 0.001; right: 0.57 ± 0.11 vs. HC: 0.80 ± 0.07, p < 0.001) without further progression at the AD stage. MD showed a right-lateralized progression (HC → MCI → AD: left 0.53 → 0.74 → 0.78, right 0.51 → 0.71 → 0.77; p < 0.001), with a significant increase only in right MD from MCI to AD (p = 0.014). CSF biomarkers revealed a hierarchical depletion of Aβ42 (AD: 370.7 ± 145.9 vs. HC: 910.8 ± 191.5 pg./mL, p < 0.001) and accumulation of tau (t-tau: AD>MCI > HC, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified right hippocampal MD and t-tau as optimal classifiers for AD.\n\nCONCLUSION: The framework reveals distinct biomarker trajectories: DTI-ALPS distinguishes symptomatic AD from preclinical stages, while right hippocampal MD progression reflects tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Early FA reductions in MCI combined with CSF profiles suggest a hierarchical staging model: amyloid-associated perivascular dysfunction is associated with asymmetric tau-driven hippocampal degeneration. This multimodal approach provides clinically actionable biomarkers for AD progression monitoring.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with increased risk of both death and dementia in older adults, but no prognostic models currently exist to help identify which individuals are at greatest risk of long-term adverse outcomes. Our primary objective was to develop a single prognostic model that uses electronic health record (EHR) data to predict 5-year risk of dementia or death in older veterans who have experienced TBI.\n\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using EHR data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Participants were US veterans aged 55 years or older without dementia who had a TBI diagnosis and received care between 2002 and 2019. Potential predictor variables included demographics, medical comorbidities, mental health conditions, and health care utilization factors. We used multinomial logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator to develop a prognostic model for 5-year risk of dementia or death.\n\nRESULTS: Cohort members (N = 113,779) had a mean ± SD age of 68 ± 10 years; 6% were female, and 20% were non-White or Hispanic. The key predictors of dementia or death included older age; male sex; number of inpatient visits; and comorbidities such as Parkinson disease, diabetes, weight loss, epilepsy, substance use disorder, and psychosis. The c-statistics were 0.756 (95% CI 0.751-0.761) for dementia and 0.783 (0.779-0.786) for death. Among those in the lowest predicted decile of dementia risk, 3% developed dementia within 5 years, compared with 43% of those in the highest predicted decile of risk. Similarly, the proportion of participants who died without dementia was 4% among those in the lowest predicted decile of risk compared with 64% in the highest predicted decile of risk.\n\nDISCUSSION: A single prognostic model that includes demographics, comorbidities, and utilization variables can predict risk of dementia or death in older veterans who have experienced TBI with good accuracy. Additional studies are needed to determine how this information might be best used to support better care.",

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence highlights the exacerbation and sustained Parkinson's disease (PD) progression following COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), which can persist in the brain post-infection, is a likely contributor, but how it drives this neuropathology is unclear.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of long COVID's impact on PD and identify mechanism that contribute to the continuous progression of PD.\n\nMETHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD was stereotactically injected into the substantia nigra pars compacta of α-synuclein (αSyn) A53T mice within a chronic stress-genetic susceptibility model. We characterized the pathological impact of RBD using motor and non-motor behavioral tests, fMRI-based functional connectivity, in vivo electrophysiology, immunofluorescence, and αSyn aggregate analysis. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we then employed RNA-sequencing, transmission electron microscopy, microglial depletion, and comparative studies in αSyn A53T mice lacking RTP801 (αSyn A53T+; RTP801-/-).\n\nRESULTS: RBD accelerated PD-related motor and non-motor symptom deterioration, impaired brain functional connectivity, and reduced neuronal excitability. It exacerbated dopaminergic neuron degeneration and αSyn aggregation. RTP801 was identified as a critical mediator of RBD-induced PD progression, with its sustained upregulation in dopaminergic neurons dependent on microglial activation. Mechanistically, initially activates microglia induced an increase in neuronal RTP801 via IL-6 and IL-8. RBD leaded to mitochondrial dysfunction, mtDNA release, and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway between neurons and microglia, triggering a mtDNA-cGAS-STING-IFNβ/RTP801 feedback loop, driving neurodegeneration.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 RBD exacerbates PD progression through a pathogenic crosstalk between microglia and neurons. This neurotoxic signaling is mediated by a mitochondrial mtDNA-cGAS-STING-IFNβ/RTP801 axis. Targeting RTP801 or the STING pathway may therefore represent a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate long COVID-associated progression of PD.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, resulting in dopamine deficiency and motor dysfunction. While levodopa (L-DOPA) remains the gold standard for symptomatic treatment, its long-term administration is associated with complications such as motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, and oxidative stress. Given these limitations, interest has grown in plant-derived bioactive compounds for their potential neuroprotective and disease-modifying effects.\n\nMETHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science, focusing on peer-reviewed studies published between 2023 and March 2025. The inclusion criteria targeted in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies as well as clinical trials that directly compared levodopa with plant-derived compounds in the context of PD. Key search terms included \"Parkinson's disease,\" \"levodopa,\" \"phytochemicals,\" and \"plant-based neuroprotection\".\n\nRESULTS: Recent studies have highlighted several classes of plant-based compounds-including polyphenols (resveratrol, curcumin, EGCG), flavonoids (quercetin, apigenin, naringenin), alkaloids (berberine, caffeine, L-DOPA derived from Mucuna pruriens), and terpenoids (ginkgolide B, celastrol)-as potential neuroprotective agents. These compounds exert multiple actions, such as reducing oxidative stress, blocking neuroinflammation, preventing α-synuclein aggregation, and protecting mitochondria. Although levodopa effectively addresses motor symptoms, these phytochemicals may complement conventional therapy by targeting underlying disease processes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Although levodopa is indispensable for the symptomatic management of PD, emerging evidence supports the integration of plant-derived bioactive compounds as adjunct therapies with disease-modifying potential. Future research should prioritize improving bioavailability, developing standardized formulations, and conducting long-term clinical trials to evaluate the translational applicability of these natural agents in Parkinson's disease therapy.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sex-based differences in cognitive and behavioral symptoms have been previously reported in Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as the effects of motor lateralization and phenotypes at onset. However, no studies investigated the interaction between these variables.\n\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether sex differences interact with motor phenotype and lateralization at the onset of cognitive and neurobehavioral symptoms.\n\nMETHODS: Data from 304 PD patients (119 women and 185 men) were retrospectively examined, including comprehensive neurologic, neuropsychological, and neurobehavioral assessments. MANCOVAs on tests divided based on the results of a principal component analysis were performed to compare cognitive and behavioral performance, considering sex, motor phenotype at onset, and onset lateralization as grouping variables. Analyses were also performed on a subsample of patients (n = 200) in which subgroups were balanced in terms of motor and demographic features.\n\nRESULTS: Significant sex effects were found, with females showing higher performance compared to males in verbal long-term memory (p = 0.00003), social cognition (p = 0.0001), and naming tasks (p = 0.03009). Significant interactions between motor phenotype and sex were found: rigid-akinetic (RA) females showed higher performance than other groups in a verbal memory task (p = 0.0183), and tremor-dominant (TD) females made more errors than the other groups in an inhibitory control task (p = 0.03853). Interestingly, RA females performed better on verbal learning than tremor-dominant (TD) males (p = 0.00911), suggesting that sex effects overcome motor phenotype in this cognitive function. No significant interactions were found between sex and lateralization at onset concerning cognitive variables. However, patients with right-sided onset, in particular females, self-reported higher levels of behavioral symptoms.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the complex relationship between demographic and PD motor features in delineating the clinical phenotype, which should be considered in designing patient-tailored strategies for disease monitoring and intervention.",

        "Abstract": "During late life, \"average\" does not mean \"intact.\" For example, cross-sectional data from a common word list learning test show that average delayed word recall raw score at age 80 (5/15) is approximately half that at age 56 to 66 (9/15). Cognitive and neurobiological dissolution is therefore implicitly incorporated into concepts of the aging brain. This position is being challenged through investigations on \"superaging,\" a term that was coined at the Northwestern Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) to define persons ≥ 80 years with delayed word recall raw scores at least equal to those of individuals 20 to 30 years younger. During the first 25 years of this program we established that superagers constitute not only a neuropsychological but also a neurobiological phenotype distinctive from cognitively average age peers. With respect to brain structure, superagers have cortical volumes no different than neurotypical adults 20 to 30 years younger in contrast to neurotypical peers who do show such age-related shrinkage; they also have a region in the cingulate gyrus that is thicker than younger neurotypical adults. With respect to cellular biology, superagers have fewer Alzheimer's disease-type changes in the brain, greater size of entorhinal neurons, fewer inflammatory microglia in white matter, better preserved cholinergic innervation, and a greater density of evolutionarily progressive von Economo neurons. In the future, deeper characterization of the superaging phenotype may lead to interventions that enhance resistance and resilience to involutional changes considered part of average (i.e., \"normal\") brain aging. This line of work is helping to revise common misperceptions about the cognitive potential of senescence and has inspired investigations throughout the United States and abroad. HIGHLIGHTS: \"Normal cognitive aging\" is a term that spans a broad spectrum from average for age to well beyond. \"Superaging\" at the Northwestern University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) refers to a unique cognitive and biological phenotype. Post mortem findings support resilience and resistance to neuropathologic changes of aging.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the prevalence of primary headache disorders in people with MS (pwMS) compared to healthy controls (HCs) over a two-year period and compare headache features between the two groups.\n\nBACKGROUND: Several studies have found an increased prevalence of migraine in pwMS; however, most of them were cross-sectional or case-control in design, and relied on retrospective assessment of headache disorders, which introduces significant bias. Currently, there is no prospective study assessing primary headaches in pwMS longitudinally.\n\nMETHODS: This two-year, prospective, longitudinal, controlled study recruited consecutive pwMS attending the MS outpatient clinic of Eginition University Hospital in Athens, Greece, and age- and sex-matched HCs. Participants were assessed prospectively for headache disorders and their characteristics in four timepoints (every six months) for two years, using headache diaries.\n\nRESULTS: Among 192 participants (96 pwMS and 96 HCs) who completed the study, the prevalence of any primary headache disorder was significantly higher in pwMS (60.4%) compared to HCs (41.7%) (p = 0.014). Migraine was more prevalent in pwMS (31.3%) than in HCs (16.7%) (p = 0.028), while the prevalence of tension-type headache (TTH) did not differ significantly between groups (34.4% in pwMS vs. 29.2% in HCs, p = 0.535). PwMS experienced more frequent, longer, and more intense headache attacks, with higher use of acute medication. Logistic regression showed pwMS were more likely to experience migraine and any headache compared to HCs (OR = 2.29; 95% CI: 1.13 - 4.64; p = 0.022 and OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.26 - 4.21; p = 0.007, respectively).\n\nCONCLUSION: Migraine is more prevalent and burdensome in pwMS compared to HCs, while TTH prevalence is similar between the groups. The prospective, longitudinal design, use of structured headache diaries, and inclusion of a matched control group strengthen the reliability of these findings and addresses the limitations of previous studies. These results highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying the increased migraine prevalence in pwMS.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Visual hallucinations (VHs) are a common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) believed to arise from disruptions to the functional architecture supporting sensory integration and attentional control. Across synucleinopathies, increased pathological burden in the amygdala and deficits in cholinergic modulation have been linked to VHs. However, the interaction of these changes and their combined contribution to the neurobiological mechanisms underlying hallucinatory phenomena remain poorly understood.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the convergent impact of amygdala and cholinergic dysfunction on VHs in PD.\n\nMETHODS: Seventy patients with PD, including 30 with and 40 without VHs, underwent structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Seed-based analyses were performed to examine whether altered functional connectivity between the bilateral amygdala and the cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) with cortical networks involved in attention and visual processing is related to the presence of VHs.\n\nRESULTS: Patients with VHs exhibited reduced amygdala connectivity with the visual network and reduced left amygdala connectivity with both dorsal and ventral attentional networks compared with those without VHs. Furthermore, mediation analyses indicated that the association between amygdala-attentional network dysconnectivity and VHs was at least partially explained by functional interactions between the left NBM and the ventral attention network. These functional alterations were not associated with amygdala or NBM volumes, suggesting they may occur independently of measurable gray matter atrophy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that VHs are associated with a network signature of impaired functional connectivity linking the amygdala, cholinergic dysfunction, and cortical networks associated with attention and perception. These results highlight the interplay between distinct but related neural circuitries and provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of VHs in PD. © 2025 The Author(s).

        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Integration of evidence-based innovations, such as serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) measurement into routine practice represents a pivotal opportunity to advance personalized care in multiple sclerosis (MS) management. This study assessed neurologists' openness to adopting healthcare innovations (sNfL testing), focusing on individual characteristics and structural factors like workplace environment and resources.\n\nMETHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted in partnership with the Spanish Society of Neurology. Neurologists caring for patients with MS completed an e-survey assessing openness to innovation using the Openness subscale of the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS), alongside measures of empathy, healthcare-related regret, risk preferences, burnout, and workplace communication. Logistic and linear regression models were conducted to identify predictors of openness to innovation.\n\nRESULTS: One hundred and sixteen neurologists were studied. Mean age (SD) was 41.9 (10.1) years, 53.4% were male. Mean experience as neurologists was 16.0 (9.2) years and 96.6% worked in an academic hospital. Median (IQR) EBPAS-Openness score was 3.0 (2.5-3.5), with 54.3% (n=63) of participants demonstrating openness to innovation. Participants fully dedicated to MS care, managing higher patient volumes, engaged in research publications, with access to serum neurofilament light chain testing, and a greater propensity for risk-taking, were more open to adopting innovations than their counterparts. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that access to sNfL testing and higher empathy levels were significant predictors of openness (OR=3.52, CI 95%: 1.3-10.3; p=0.016 and OR=1.09, CI 95%: 1.0-1.2; p=0.005, respectively). Complementary linear regression reinforced the significant positive association between higher EBPAS-Openness scores and empathy (estimate=0.024, p=0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION: Neurologists exhibited a varied openness to innovation. Implementing initial innovative strategies in clinical practice should prioritize neurologists with specific profiles to support the integration of emerging tools and personalized healthcare approaches in MS care.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Ocrelizumab (OCR), a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, is highly efficient in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS). We assessed early cellular B-cell profiles in patients prior to OCR treatment, on OCR treatment, and after 15 months of therapy discontinuation. This study aims to provide new clues about the mechanisms of action of OCR and about disease pathophysiology.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with early, treatment-naive, RR-MS were included from 11 centers participating in an ancillary study of the ENSEMBLE trial (NCT03085810) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of OCR. The phenotypic B-cell immune profile was comprehensively assessed in 18 patients by spectral flow cytometry at baseline, after 1 year of OCR treatment, and compared with 10 healthy volunteers (HVs) (matched for age and sex) on cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We also analyzed B-cell reconstitution after a median time of 15 months after trial withdrawal in three patients by flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing.\n\nRESULTS: Using spectral flow cytometry we defined the proportions and absolute numbers of naive, transitional, Ig-G, Ig-A, Ig-M memory B cells, Ig-G, Ig-A, Ig-M plasmablasts, and plasma cells. At baseline we found an increased frequency of IgG-secreting B cells in MS patients compared to HV. During OCR treatment, the proportion of the different subsets of B cells was strongly modified. In the mature clusters, we observed that the treatment partially spared memory IgA B cells. In parallel, we observed that differentiated IgA plasmablasts and plasma cells were more increased than the other differentiated clusters. Interestingly, in the three patients who stopped the treatment single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the B cells that reappeared were mainly naive with an inflammatory and migratory phenotype concomitantly to a rise of regulatory B cells.\n\nDISCUSSION: Our findings support an increased regulatory phenotype of remaining B cells under treatment with OCR and replenishment of undifferentiated B cells accumulating features of inflammatory and migratory patterns after OCR discontinuation, counterbalanced by an increased proportion of regulatory B cells.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to create a reliable and scalable framework for detecting Parkinson's disease (PD) using spiral drawings. It integrates advanced machine learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy and practical application in clinical settings.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Spiral drawing data were collected from a comprehensive dataset, including samples from both Parkinson's patients and healthy individuals. Three deep learning models-ResNet50, VGG16, and EfficientNetB0-were used to extract detailed patterns from the drawings. To enhance model performance, four feature selection techniques were applied: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and ANOVA. Six different classifiers (Support Vector Machine [SVM], Random Forest [RF], Multi-Layer Perceptron [MLP], XGBoost, CatBoost, and voting classifiers) were tested. The system's diagnostic accuracy was measured using four metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Heatmaps and ROC curves were created to visualize the results.\n\nRESULTS: The models achieved high classification performance with different configurations. For example, ResNet50 with PCA and MLP reached the highest accuracy (98%) and AUC-ROC (97%). Similarly, SVM with PCA achieved accuracy (92%) and AUC-ROC (98%). For VGG16, combining LASSO with XGBoost resulted in high F1-scores (90%) and AUC-ROC (93%), while the voting classifiers with PCA achieved an AUC-ROC of 98%. EfficientNetB0 combined with RFE and XGBoost delivered exceptional accuracy (98%) with robust overall metrics. CatBoost with LASSO achieved balanced performance, showing high sensitivity (89%) and AUC-ROC (96%). Ensemble methods, like voting classifiers, consistently provided strong AUC-ROC values but showed variability in accuracy and sensitivity compared to individual classifiers like MLP and SVM.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that combining advanced techniques for feature extraction, selection, and classification can significantly improve PD detection accuracy. Future research should focus on integrating multiple data sources and exploring real-time applications to enhance scalability and clinical utility.",

        "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common and costly chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with the highest impact on public health worldwide. Pathological hallmarks of AD include progressive cognitive decline and memory impairment, dominantly mediated by oxidative neurodegeneration. Oxidative stress is commonly recognized as a key factor in the pathophysiological progression of AD. Despite significant advancements, a definitive and effective therapeutic intervention for AD remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the neuroprotective potential of ambroxol (Amb), known for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Given ambroxol's potential neuroprotective effects, we explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, explicitly examining its role in attenuating scopolamine-induced oxidative stress-mediated activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as well as its modulation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) signaling, which is a key contributor to neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. AD pathology is induced by scopolamine administration, leading to excessive lipid peroxidation (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which leads to a decline in critical antioxidant proteins, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). However, ambroxol treatment effectively attenuated oxidative stress by reducing the production of reactive oxidative species while restoring the expression of key antioxidant proteins. Similarly, ambroxol attenuated oxidative stress-induced JNK activation and modulated Akt and GSK-3β alterations. Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses revealed that ambroxol attenuated reactive gliosis by suppressing the expression of GFAP and Iba-1, alongside the downregulation of key pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and phosphorylated NF-κB (p-p65). Scopolamine also compromised synaptic integrity and induced deficits in memory formation and spatial learning. In contrast, ambroxol promoted synaptic integrity by upregulating the expression of SNAP-23 and PSD-95, thereby ameliorating scopolamine-induced impairments in spatial learning and memory.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are a core manifestation of normal and pathological aging and are potentially linked to geographical differences in social and physical exposomes. Previous studies have not examined the impact of WMHs burden on neurodegeneration and cognition in healthy controls (HCs) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) across geographic regions. This study addressed this gap by assessing the impact of WMHs burden on participants with and without dementia from Latin America (LA) and the United States (US).\n\nMETHODS: The study comprised 994 participants, including HCs (n = 402), AD (n = 359), and bvFTD subjects (n = 233) from LA and the US. WMHs and their association with grey matter (GM) atrophy, assessed through GM volume and cortical thickness, were evaluated and compared among groups (HCs, AD, and bvFTD) in LA and the US using a voxel-wise brain imaging approach (p < 0.05 family-wise error-corrected for multiple comparisons, minimum cluster size = 50 voxels). Multiple regressions analysis were employed to examine geographic differences in WMHs burden, WMHs-GM associations, and the effect of WMHs on cognitive performance, as assessed by the Mini-Mental State examination.\n\nRESULTS: In the LA cohort only, higher WMHs load was associated with greater GM atrophy across all groups (HCs, AD, bvFTD), with a specific neurodegenerative pattern involving orbitofrontal, cingulate, and temporal areas. HCs from LA showed a greater WMHs load than their US counterparts, and this effect was dependent on GM atrophy. Finally, WMHs burden negatively impacted cognitive performance in dementia subjects, with a greater effect observed in bvFTD subjects from the US.\n\nCONCLUSION: WMHs have a more pronounced impact on neurodegeneration across the LA cohort, with a worse impact on HCs, which also show higher WMHs burden than their US counterparts. This could increase the risk of developing dementia. Moreover, WMHs burden differentially impacts cognition, with a greater negative effect observed in bvFTD subjects from the US. These findings highlight geographic variations in WMHs-related conditions, offering valuable insights for tailored future research.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become increasingly evident. In addition to well-established features like neurodegeneration, amyloid-beta and tau deposition, or glial changes, other processes-such as metabolic, circulatory, and inflammatory factors-may also play a key role in driving or accelerating AD-related pathology and cognitive decline. These factors represent important targets for slowing disease progression.\n\nOBJECTIVES: Although many studies have examined individual risk factors and meta-analyses have been performed, a large-scale, comprehensive comparison using formal medical data from a single, unified cohort is needed.\n\nDESIGN: A retrospective case-control study leveraging comprehensive health database.\n\nSETTING: Data were obtained from the UK-Biobank, a large (∼500 K people) population-based biomedical database in the United Kingdom.\n\nPARTICIPANTS: The study included participants aged 40-69 at enrollment between 2006 and 2010, comprising 3,843 individuals who were clinically diagnosed with AD by August 2022 and 387,275 individuals without dementia or cognitive-impairment diagnoses.\n\nMEASUREMENTS: ICD-10-coded diagnoses, recorded at least 10 years prior to AD diagnosis, were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to estimate the impact and significance of various medical conditions and their interactions with genetic risk factors, while accounting for demographic determinants.\n\nRESULTS: The analysis identified 45 medical factors (96 ICD-10 entities) across multiple systems-particularly metabolic, circulatory, gastrointestinal, and sensorimotor-that significantly differentiated individuals with clinical AD from cognitively unimpaired individuals. Interaction analyses revealed that circulatory and metabolic factors had a weaker influence on AD risk in Apolipoprotein E ε4 carriers, suggesting a gene-environment interaction in disease susceptibility.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings enhance the understanding of system-level risk factors for clinical AD, highlight the relevance of less frequently reported factors in the AD prevention literature-such as gastrointestinal and sensorimotor disorders-and underscore the complex interplay between genetic susceptibility and vascular risk factors.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small and highly conserved non-coding RNA molecules, have emerged as promising molecular biomarkers due to their regulatory roles in gene expression and stability in blood.\n\nMETHODS: We used measurements of 64 plasma miRNAs from 145 participants in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort, including 74 probable AD patients and 71 cognitively normal (CN) older adults. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) with factor rotation for dimension reduction to identify AD-associated principal components (PCs) and their key miRNAs with factor loadings higher than 0.8. We investigated their association with amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (A/T/N) biomarkers and cognition. After identifying the candidate target genes of key miRNAs, we performed pathway enrichment analysis. We conducted mediation analyses to assess the effect of the associations between miRNAs and A/T/N biomarkers on AD diagnosis and cognition. Finally, we used a machine learning approach to evaluate the performance of key miRNAs for AD classification.\n\nRESULTS: PCA identified one PC as significantly associated with AD. The PC was also significantly associated with CSF p-tau levels, hippocampal volume, and cognition. Two key miRNAs (miR-423-5p and miR-92a-3p) in the PC were associated with AD. Lower levels of miR-423-5p and miR-92a-3p were associated with reduced hippocampal volume and worse cognition, and lower levels of miR-423-5p were associated with higher brain amyloid deposition. Pathway enrichment analysis identified several significant biological processes, including memory, protein phosphorylation, and the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate biosynthetic process. Mediation analysis revealed that miR-423-5p, but not miR-92a-3p, had indirect effects on AD diagnosis and memory performance through brain amyloid deposition and brain atrophy. Machine learning analysis demonstrated that incorporating two key miRNAs improved the performance of demographic information for AD classification.\n\nCONCLUSION: Plasma miR-423-5p and miR-92a-3p are implicated in AD pathology and cognitive decline, providing insights into their roles in disease mechanisms. This study suggests the potential of these miRNAs as blood-based molecular biomarkers for AD.",

        "Abstract": "Lifestyle-based interventions, including dietary modifications, can reduce dementia risk. In this regard, dietary supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) has shown potential therapeutic benefits in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These effects are widely presumed to be mediated by hepatic conversion of MCT into circulating ketones. However, the physiological and cellular mechanisms underlying the benefits of MCT remain understudied, particularly in the context of AD. Here, we investigated the cellular and molecular changes occurring in the brain and systemically in response to dietary supplementation with MCT versus a ketogenic diet (KD). The experimental design consisted of comparing a 70% carbohydrate control diet to either a control diet supplemented with 10% MCT or a carbohydrate-free high fat KD. Diets were tested in two AD mouse models, slow-progressing 3xTg-AD mice that model pre-symptomatic/early stages and rapidly-progressing 5xFAD mice that model late stages of the disease. We found that MCT supplementation and KD both improved hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory, increased dendritic spine density of hippocampal neurons, and modulated hippocampal expression of genes associated with mitochondrial functions, synaptic structure, and insulin signaling in AD mouse models. However, unlike KD, MCT supplementation did not elevate circulating ketones, suggesting different mechanisms. Indeed, MCT enhanced the peripheral insulin response of AD mice, while KD conversely unveiled their latent metabolic vulnerability, increasing their hyperglycaemia, body weight gain, and adiposity. The systemic metabolic disturbances of AD mice correlated with transcriptomic alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism and ketogenesis genes and increased lipid droplet accumulation. These liver metabolic abnormalities were partially reversed by both MCT supplementation and KD, but in distinct ways. Notably, KD selectively triggered hepatic neutral lipid depletion and prominent proinflammatory gene expression while MCT down-regulated expression of cholesterol-related genes. Collectively, these findings reveal that MCT supplementation in the context of AD improves cognition and systemic metabolism without elevating circulating ketone levels.",

        "Abstract": "Non-invasive recordings of magnetoencephalography have been used for developing biomarkers for neural changes associated with Parkinson's disease that can be measured across the entire course of the disease. These studies, however, have yielded inconsistent findings. Here, we investigated whether analysing motor cortical activity within the context of large-scale brain network activity provides a more sensitive marker of changes in Parkinson's disease using magnetoencephalography. We extracted motor cortical beta power and beta bursts from resting-state magnetoencephalography scans of patients with Parkinson's disease (N = 28) and well-matched healthy controls (N = 36). To situate beta bursts in their brain network contexts, we used a time-delay-embedded hidden Markov model to extract brain network activity and investigated co-occurrence patterns between brain networks and beta bursts. Parkinson's disease was associated with decreased beta power in motor cortical power spectra, but no significant differences in motor cortical beta-burst dynamics occurred when using a conventional beta-burst analysis. Dynamics of a large-scale sensorimotor network extracted with the time-delay-embedded hidden Markov model approach revealed significant decreases in the occurrence of this network with Parkinson's disease. By comparing conventional burst and time-delay-embedded hidden Markov model state occurrences, we observed that motor beta bursts occurred during both sensorimotor and non-sensorimotor network activations. When using the large-scale network information provided by the time-delay-embedded hidden Markov model to focus on bursts that were active during sensorimotor network activations, significant decreases in burst dynamics could be observed in patients with Parkinson's disease. In conclusion, our findings suggest that decreased motor cortical beta power in Parkinson's disease is prominently associated with changes in sensorimotor network dynamics using magnetoencephalography. Thus, investigating large-scale networks or considering the large-scale network context of motor cortical activations may be crucial for identifying alterations in the sensorimotor network that are prevalent in Parkinson's disease and might help resolve contradicting findings in the literature.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the principal cause of dementia and requires the early diagnosis of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are at high risk of progressing. Early diagnosis is imperative for optimizing clinical management and selecting proper therapeutic interventions. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers have been widely investigated for predicting the conversion of MCI to AD, and recent advances in deep learning (DL) methods offer enhanced capabilities for identifying subtle neurodegenerative changes over time.\n\nMETHODS: We selected 228 MCI participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had at least three T1-weighted MRI scans within 18 months of baseline. MRI volumes underwent bias correction, segmentation, and radiomics feature extraction. A 3D residual network (ResNet3D) was trained using a pairwise ranking loss to capture single-timepoint risk scores. Longitudinal analyses were performed by extracting deep convolutional neural network (CNN) embeddings and gray matter radiomics for each scan, which were put into a time-aware long short-term memory (LSTM) model with an attention mechanism.\n\nRESULTS: A single-timepoint ResNet3D model achieved modest performance (c-index ~ 0.70). Incorporating longitudinal MRI files or downstream survival models led to a pronounced prognostic improvement (c-index:0.80-0.90), but was not further improved by longitudinal radiomics data. Time-specific classification within two- and three-year and five-year windows after the last MRI acquisition showed high accuracy (AUC > 0.85). Several radiomics, including gray matter surface to volume and elongation, emerged as the most predictive features. Each SD change in the gray matter surface to volume change within the last visit was associated with an increased risk of developing AD (HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.25-1.79).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the value of structural MRI within the advanced DL architectures for predicting MCI-to-AD conversion. The approach may enable earlier risk stratification and targeted interventions for individuals most likely to progress. limitations in sample size and computational resources warrant larger, more diverse studies to confirm these observations and explore additional improvements.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Some individuals with migraine fail to respond adequately to preventive treatments, bearing most of migraine burden. The European Headache Federation (EHF) classifies these individuals into resistant migraine (ResM) or refractory migraine (RefM) according to treatment failures, debilitating headache days, and disease duration. We investigated the evolution of these categories over six months in patients treated at tertiary headache centers and whether they accurately reflect disability and burden.\n\nMETHODS: Participants from the multicenter, prospective REFINE study were classified into three categories of treatment responsiveness, namely RefM, ResM, and non-refractory non-resistant migraine (NRNRM). The primary objective was to determine the trajectories of category changes over six months. Secondary outcomes included changes in the 6-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), Headache-Attributed Lost Time (HALT), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D) scores.\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 489 participants were included with a median age of 45 years (IQR = 36-53); 389 participants (79.7%) were female; 256 (52.4%) had NRNRM, 178 (36.4%) ResM, and 55 (11.2%) RefM. At follow-up, 200/256 (78.1%) NRNRM remained stable, while 56/256 (21.9%) progressed to ResM. Among those with ResM, 98/178 (55.1%) remained stable, 72/178 (40.5%) improved to NRNRM, and 8/178 (4.5%) worsened to RefM. Among participants with RefM, 37/55 (67.3%) remained stable, while 18/55 (32.7%) improved to NRNRM. Participants with RefM and ResM presented significantly higher scores at baseline than those with NRNRM. Over time, HIT-6, HALT, and HADS-A scores improved substantially in the overall cohort (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.006, respectively). Improvements were observed in participants with ResM across all scores and HIT-6 and HALT for NRNRM, but no improvement was noted in participants with RefM.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Over six months, ~ 40% of ResM and ~ 30% of RefM individuals improved to NRNRM, while ~ 20% of NRNRM developed treatment resistance after receiving care in tertiary headache centers. Participants with ResM had a better prognosis than those with RefM. While both ResM and RefM reflect high migraine disability burden, they might present relevant differences in their management and prognosis.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, imposing a substantial burden on individuals and society. While existing therapies can reduce the symptoms of AD, they do not offer genuine therapeutic effectiveness. Adiponectin Receptor Agonist (ADN-R Ag) has been proposed as a novel therapeutic agent for AD. This study aims to evaluate its efficacy in treating AD model mice.\n\nMETHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted up to May 3, 2025. Research investigating the impact of ADN-R Ag on cognitive performance and associated molecular pathways in Alzheimer’s disease models, specifically APP/PS1, P301S, and 5XFAD mice, was incorporated. The Alzheimer’s disease models in the study were male and ranged in age from 5.5 to 8 months. Studies evaluating the effect of ADN-R Ag on AD model mice through cognitive function tests and related molecular mechanisms were included. Methodological quality assessment was performed using the CAMARADES tool for animal studies. The meta-analysis was performed following Cochrane guidelines.\n\nRESULTS: Six articles were included for the review. ADN-R Ag significantly improved cognitive function in the meta-analysis. The weighted mean difference of ADN-R Ag was 21.75 (95% CI: 16.61–26.88; p < 0.001) for alternation rate percentage in the Y-maze, 20.46 (95% CI: 11.41–29.51, p < 0.001) for novel object exploration time percentage in the novel object recognition (NOR) test, -15.83 (95% CI: -23.33 to -8.32, p < 0.001) for escape latency in the Morris water maze (MWM), and 13.89 (95% CI: 8.84–18.94; p < 0.001) for target quadrant time in the probe test. Additionally, ADN-R Ag was reported to mitigate AD pathology by reducing Aβ depositions through inhibition of GSK3β/BACE1/NF-κB pathway, suppressing neuronal inflammation by suppressing microglial and astrocytes activity and reducing and IL1β and TNFα levels, enhancing autophagy, and improving mitochondrial function with significant involvement of the AMPK pathway.\n\nCONCLUSION: Based on the current study, ADN-R Ag has therapeutic effects on AD. However, considering the complex underlying molecular mechanisms and limited prior studies, further research is needed.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12883-025-04356-5.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is a disease in which local ischemia and hypoxia of brain tissues are caused by obstruction of blood vessels in the brain, which in turn triggers brain tissue damage and neurological dysfunction. Recent studies have made significant progress in understanding the role of exosomes in ischemic stroke. Exosomes exhibit anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-apoptotic, angiogenic, and neuroregenerative effects, as well as glial scar reduction and drug delivery effects in ischemic stroke. However, there is a notable gap in bibliometric analyses that focus specifically on this subject. This study systematically evaluated the current knowledge and identified emerging research trends regarding exosomes in ischemic stroke through a bibliometric analysis.\n\nMETHODS: We retrieved research articles on the role of exosomes in ischemic stroke published between 2004 and 2023 from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database and then conducted a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and the bibliometrix package in the R programming environment.\n\nRESULTS: A comprehensive analysis of 374 publications from 38 countries revealed a steady increase in research focused on exosomes in ischemic stroke. This analysis significantly emphasized the contributions of researchers from China and the United States. Key research institutions in this field include Henry Ford Health System, Henry Ford Hospital, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The International Journal of Molecular Sciences is the top journal in terms of publication output, and Stroke is the most frequently co-cited journal. This extensive study involved 468 authors, the most prolific of whom are Michael Chopp, Zhengbiao Zhang, and Liang Zhao, Hongqi Xin is the most frequently co-cited researcher. The primary areas of investigation are the role of endogenous exosomes in initiating and progressing ischemic stroke, as well as the potential therapeutic applications of exogenous exosomes.\n\nCONCLUSION: In the context of ischemic stroke, a recent bibliometric evaluation provided a comprehensive analysis of research trends and developments related to exosomes. The findings of this study highlight current research frontiers and identify significant emerging trends. These findings offer a crucial resource for researchers focusing on exploring exosomes.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a chronic neurological disorder associated with a variety of abnormal visual symptoms. However, the mechanisms of visual processing in migraine are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate neuromagnetic activity abnormalities under visual stimuli in migraine patients using magnetoencephalography (MEG).\n\nMETHODS: Magnetoencephalography recordings during exposure to visual stimuli were collected for 22 episodic migraine patients without aura during the interictal period and 22 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs). The spectral power and functional connectivity (FC) of visual neuromagnetic activation were estimated using minimum norm estimation combined with the Welch technique and corrected amplitude envelope correlation.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to HCs, migraineurs exhibited attenuated spectral power in the gamma2 band of the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortices, bilateral posterior cingulate cortices, bilateral temporal poles, right lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and left transverse temporal cortex. Migraineurs also exhibited the following increases in FC relative to HCs between vision- and pain-related brain regions: In the alpha band, FC between the left cuneus and left medial orbitofrontal cortex was significantly increased. In the beta band, FC between the left lateral occipital cortex and bilateral anterior cingulate cortices was significantly increased. In the gamma1 band, FC of the right cuneus with the bilateral insulae, left parahippocampal cortex, bilateral posterior central cortices, and bilateral anterior cingulate cortices was significantly increased. Migraineurs also showed significantly increased FC between the left lateral occipital cortex and the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, left posterior central cortex, and bilateral anterior cingulate cortices. The clinical variables (headache history, attack frequency, and pain intensity) had no significant correlation with MEG results.\n\nCONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings demonstrate altered spectral power in pain-processing regions and altered FC between vision and pain-related regions in migraineurs under visual stimuli in multi-frequencies. These results may contribute to understanding the relationship between visual dysfunction and headache onset in migraineurs, providing valuable insights into the underlying pathophysiology.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Salvageable ischemic tissue has become the treatment target of endovascular therapy (EVT). This study proposed a new concept of salvageable time window that measures the dynamic process of salvageable tissue. We hypothesized that patients who received EVT beyond the salvageable time window would have limited benefits.\n\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter study based on the INSPIRE (International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry), enrolling patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion within 6 hours of stroke onset (August 2011-April 2022, 22 sites). Patients were divided into 3 groups: EVT delivered within the salvageable time window, EVT delivered outside the salvageable time window, and a historical no EVT control. Salvageable time window was calculated by salvageable tissue volume divided by core growth rate, which estimates the time for infarction expanding to the whole ischemic region. Patients were considered outside the window if EVT was initiated after their estimated salvageable window. The primary outcome was a good functional outcome defined by 3-month modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2. Propensity score matching was applied to reduce selection bias among groups.\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 1291 patients (mean age 70.3 years, 43.6% female) were included in the study, with 456 in the no EVT group, 727 in the EVT within salvageable time window group, and 108 in the EVT outside salvageable time window group. After propensity score matching (n=62 per group), patients received EVT within the salvageable time window had higher odds of good functional outcome compared with those with no EVT (48% versus 29%, odds ratio, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.09-4.81]; P=0.028), without increased risk of bleeding (type 2 parenchymal hematoma of 2% versus 3%, odds ratio, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.04-5.57]; P=0.566). In contrast, patients received EVT outside the salvageable time window did not show improved 3-month functional outcomes (32% versus 29%, odds ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.54-2.50]; P=0.697) and demonstrated an increased bleeding risk (type 2 parenchymal hematoma of 17% versus 3%, odds ratio, 5.83 [95% CI, 1.22, 27.9]; P=0.027).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study indicates the importance of estimating the salvageable time window within 6 hours of stroke onset, as initiating endovascular treatment beyond salvageable time window may not benefit.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Food deserts (FDs) are low-income areas with poor access to healthy foods. FD residents have higher rates of several cardiovascular risk factors, but the link between FDs and stroke has not been well studied. We evaluated whether FD residence was associated with incident ischemic stroke within the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Study (GCNKSS) and whether this association was due to low income, poor food access, or both.\n\nMETHODS: All hospitalized stroke cases in the GCNK region were ascertained during calendar year 2015 using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for screening and confirmed by physician review. Patient home addresses were geocoded using Decentralized Geomarker Assessment for Multi-Site Studies. FD locations were obtained from the US Department of Agriculture Food Access Research Atlas, defined as census tracts with both poor food access and low income according to established definitions based on proximity to healthy food sources as well as area poverty rates and median household income. Population estimates were obtained from the 2015 5-year American Community Survey. Poisson regression models were used to calculate census tract-level incidence rates by FD status, as well as by food access and income categories, adjusting for age, sex, race, and income-by-access interaction.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 1,802 first-ever ischemic stroke incidents occurred in the region during the study period. Stroke patients had a mean age of 69.7 years, and 53% were female. In unadjusted models, FD residence (vs non-FD) was associated with higher stroke incidence (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.23; 95% CI 1.06-1.42; p < 0.01). After adjustment for age, sex, and race, this relationship was attenuated and no longer statistically significant (IRR 1.11; 95% CI 0.96-1.30; p = 0.17). In a model where FD status was replaced by area income and food access (i.e., the 2 components of the FD definition), low income was associated with greater stroke incidence after full adjustment (IRR 1.21; 95% CI 1.05-1.39; p = 0.01) while poor food access was not (IRR 0.91; 95% CI 0.81-1.01; p = 0.08).\n\nDISCUSSION: FD residents are at increased stroke risk, and this is primarily due to low area income rather than poor food access. Alternative measures of the food environment may help elucidate the links between income, dietary patterns, and stroke risk.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota may influence cognitive function via the gut-brain axis. This study aimed to investigate the gut microbiota profiles of 346 older Korean individuals with subjective cognitive decline but no symptoms (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or Alzheimer’s disease (AD).\n\nMETHODS: Participants aged an average of 72.3 years underwent the profiling of cognitive function, amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic variants, depression status, nutrition, and lifestyles. Human fecal bacterial FASTA/Q data (SCD, n = 24; MCI, n = 246; AD, n = 76) were processed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2) tools. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and their counts were assigned with the National Center for Biotechnology Information Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Machine learning models (random forest and XGBoost) identified key bacterial taxa differentiating groups.\n\nRESULTS: Redundancy analysis revealed associations between gut microbiota composition and cognitive function, age, gender, nutritional status, and body mass index. All three groups shared 71 common bacterial genera with distinct taxonomic profiles across cognitive states. The AD group uniquely harbored Hominisplanchenecus and Lentihominibacter, while the SCD group exclusively contained Anaerosacchariphilus and Anaerobutyricum. Phascolarctobacterium was shared between the AD and MCI groups, and Anaerostipes between the MCI and SCD groups. The SCD group showed significantly elevated Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Anaerobutyricum hallii, and Anaerostipes hadrus. Network analysis demonstrated greater microbial community complexity in the SCD group compared to the MCI and AD groups. Gut bacteria correlated with depression, Aβ deposition, APOE status, and cognitive scores.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study identified distinct gut microbiota profiles associated with different stages of cognitive impairment in older Korean adults. The observed associations between gut bacterial composition and cognitive function, neurodegeneration biomarkers, and related clinical factors suggest potential relationships that warrant further investigation. These findings contribute to the growing understanding of gut-brain interactions in cognitive aging.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13195-025-01820-9.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent multidomain prevention trials for dementia have shifted toward more targeted approaches, focusing on specific combinations of risk factors and interventions at certain times. However, the optimal combinations of modifiable risk factors that can be targeted to maximize intervention effect remain unclear. Identifying risk factor combinations with the highest prevalence and largest effect sizes can enhance efficiency of trial design.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To identify risk factor combinations that are both highly prevalent and have the most detrimental effect on cognition, and to assess their interaction effect and synergism.\n\nDESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA).\n\nSETTING: Community.\n\nPARTICIPANTS: 30,097 adults aged 45 to 85 at baseline MEASUREMENTS: The five most prevalent dyad, triad, and tetrad combinations of 12 modifiable risk factors were identified. Cognition was assessed with a composite Z-score from a neuropsychological test battery. Linear mixed effect models were used to examine the association between the identified combinations and 3-year cognitive changes. Interaction was assessed on additive scale, and synergism was explored.\n\nRESULTS: The combinations that were both highly prevalent and had the most detrimental effect on global cognition were: hearing loss and physical inactivity for the dyad (mean difference in change score = -0.07 SD; 95 % CI: -0.09 to -0.06; p < 0.001; effect size = -0.28), hearing loss, physical inactivity, and hypertension for the triad (mean difference in change score = -0.07; 95 % CI: -0.09 to -0.06; p < 0.001; effect size = -0.28), and hearing loss, physical inactivity, hypertension, and sleep disturbance for the tetrad (mean difference in change score = -0.05; 95 % CI: -0.07 to -0.03; p < 0.001; effect size = -0.20). Similar patterns were observed for memory and executive function. A significant synergistic interaction was observed between hearing loss and physical inactivity for global cognition (p = 0.005).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The combined effect of multiple risk factors varied by its combinations. The combination of hearing loss and physical inactivity offers a greater potential benefit than other dyad combinations. Hypertension and sleep disturbance can be further included for triad and tetrad combinations. Auditory health and exercise should be prioritized for multidomain interventions.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) is increasing, and currently, there are no curative treatments available for these conditions. The potential benefits of supplementation with diet-derived antioxidants and their metabolites for NDDs remain a subject of debate. In this study, we employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the potential causal relationship between elevated circulating antioxidant levels and the risk of NDDs.\n\nMETHODS: We used single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to diet-derived antioxidants and p < 1E-05 as instrumental variables (IVs). The NDDs we studied included Parkinson's disease (PD) (33,674 cases and 449,056 controls), Alzeimers disease (AD) (111,326 cases and 677,663 controls), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (27,205 cases and 110,881 controls), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (3526 cases and 9402 controls) from GWASs conducted in the European descent. Two-sample MR was performed together with a series of sensitivity analyses. The main statistical analyses were conducted using the package \"TwoSampleMR (V.0.5.6)\" in R (V.4.2.0).\n\nRESULTS: Genetically predicted levels of α-tocopherol and carotene were found to be associated with a reduced risk of ALS, with odds ratios (OR) of 0.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31, 0.66; p = 3.97 × 10^-5) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.99; p = 0.0427), respectively. Similarly, vitamin E (OR 0.70; [95% CI 0.50, 0.98]; p  = 0.0358) and ascorbate (OR 0.85; [95% CI: 0.73, 0.98]; p = 0.0216) demonstrated a protective effect against PD. Furthermore, elevated levels of retinol were associated with a reduced incidence of FTD, with an OR of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.99; p = 0.0196), although they were also linked to an increased risk of ALS (OR 1.02 [95% CI 1.01, 1.04], p = 0.0017) and PD (OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.02, 1.09], p = 0.0121). No significant causal association was observed between circulating antioxidants and AD.\n\nCONCLUSION: This MR study indicated a potential protective effect of α-tocopherol and carotene on ALS, vitamin E and ascorbate on PD, and retinol on FTD, while also identifying retinol as a risk factor for ALS and PD. These findings could contribute to the exploration of dietary therapies for NDDs. Further research is necessary to substantiate the potential associations between diet-derived antioxidants or their metabolites and the risk of NDDs in individuals.",

        "Abstract": "AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors of motor complications including wearing-off (WO) and dyskinesia during long-term levodopa (LD) therapy in Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and develop corresponding predictive models, thereby providing a basis for personalized treatment strategies.\n\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study included 208 consecutive PD patients who were recruited. The presence of WO and dyskinesia was assessed by a 9-item wearing-off questionnaire and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part IV. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to predict the risk factors of WO and dyskinesia. Predictive models for WO and dyskinesia were then constructed, and their diagnostic performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC).\n\nRESULTS: The overall prevalence rate of motor complications was 46.2% (96/208), with a prevalence of 45.7% (95/208) for WO, 22.1% (46/208) for dyskinesia, and 21.6% (45/208) for the simultaneous occurrence of WO and dyskinesia. Younger age at onset (OR 0.92, p < 0.001), higher levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD) (OR 1.00, p < 0.001), and higher Hoehn-Yahr stage (OR 3.41, p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for WO. A predictive model for WO constructed using these three variables demonstrated high diagnostic efficacy with an AUC of 0.887 (95% CI 0.842-0.932), a sensitivity of 84%, and a specificity of 83%. The independent risk factors for dyskinesia included younger age at onset (OR 0.94, p < 0.001), akinetic-rigid type (OR 2.42, p = 0.034), and higher LEDD (OR 1.01, p < 0.001). A predictive model for dyskinesia constructed using these three variables yielded an AUC value of 0.829 (95% CI 0.767-0.897), with a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 89%. The two models were both well calibrated and had a high net clinical benefit.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the prevalence of motor complications during long-term LD treatment is relatively high among PD patients in China, with WO occurring more commonly than dyskinesia. Younger age at PD onset, higher LEDD, more severe disease, and akinetic-rigid subtype are key predictors of motor complications. The predictive models developed in this study could serve as a potential tool to assist clinicians in identifying patients at higher risk for WO and dyskinesia, and may support personalized treatment optimization.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Accumulating evidence suggests that physical activity is associated with a better clinical and cognitive course in Parkinson disease (PD), yet whether these effects are subserved by structural brain alterations are largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate whether regular physical activity associates with a reduced longitudinal rate of neurodegeneration and slower cognitive decline in PD.\n\nMETHODS: In this longitudinal, observational cohort study, we used data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. We included patients with early PD who had serial assessments of regular physical activity, measured using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, along with serial MRI scans from at least 2 time points over 4 years of follow-up. Regional cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were calculated using established procedures. We used multivariate linear mixed-effects models to analyze the effect of regular physical activity on the progression of MRI parameters over time. We further used mediation models with nonparametric bootstrap to test mediation effects of longitudinal structural brain changes on the association between regular physical activity and longitudinal cognitive functioning.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 120 patients with early PD were included (mean [SD] age = 60.8 [9.3] years; 33% women). Average regular physical activity levels over time were significantly associated with slower cortical thinning in temporoparietal cortical regions, including the lateral temporal cortex, the fusiform gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the inferior parietal cortex (p < 0.05). Regular physical activity levels over time were also associated with slower volume loss in the hippocampus and the amygdala (p < 0.05). The association of regular physical activity with slower decline in memory and attention functions was mediated by slower decreases in temporoparietal cortical thickness (βPASE-HVLT, = 0.06, p = 0.050; βPASE-SDMT = 0.04, p = 0.017) and hippocampal volume (βPASE-SDMT = 0.03, p = 0.016).\n\nDISCUSSION: Regular physical activity is associated with a slower rate of neurodegeneration in the temporoparietal cortex and limbic areas in PD, which contributes to preserved cognitive function and improved long-term outcomes. This supports regular physical activity as a key intervention to delay disease progression and improve quality of life in patients with PD.",

        "Abstract": "While cerebrovascular dysfunction and reactive astrocytosis are extensively characterized hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, the dynamic relationship between reactive astrocytes and cerebral vessels remains poorly understood. Here, we used jGCaMP8f and two photon microscopy to investigate calcium signaling in multiple astrocyte subcompartments, concurrent with changes in cerebral arteriole activity, in fully awake seven-to-eight-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice, a model for AD-like pathology, and wild-type (WT) littermates. In the absence of movement, spontaneous calcium transients in barrel cortex occurred more frequently in astrocyte somata, processes, and perivascular regions of 5xFAD mice. However, evoked arteriole dilations (in response to air puff stimulation of contralateral whiskers) and concurrent calcium transients across astrocyte compartments were reduced in 5xFAD mice relative to WTs. Synchronous activity within multi-cell astrocyte networks was also impaired in the 5xFAD group. Using a custom application to assess functional coupling between astrocyte endfeet and immediately adjacent arteriole segments, we detected deficits in calcium response probability in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, endfeet calcium transients following arteriole dilations exhibited a slower onset, reduced amplitude, and lacked relative proportionality to vasomotive activity compared to WTs. The results reveal nuanced alterations in 5xFAD reactive astrocytes highlighted by impaired signaling fidelity between astrocyte endfeet and cerebral arterioles. The results have important implications for the mechanistic underpinnings of brain hypometabolism and the disruption of neurophysiological communication found in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.Significance Statement Astrocytes are an essential component of the neurovascular unit. Chronically reactive astrocyte phenotypes are mechanistically linked to deleterious features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) including impaired cerebral blood flow, hypometabolism, and synapse dysfunction/loss. Here, we use two photon imaging to show that reactive astrocytes in a fully awake mouse model of AD-like amyloid pathology are spontaneously hyperactive, exhibit impaired functional connectivity, and respond to dilations in immediately adjacent arterioles with poor fidelity. The results reveal a key point of communication breakdown between the brain and the cerebrovasculature.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a common neurological condition that contributes to strokes, dementia, disability, and mortality worldwide. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the use of neuroimaging CSVD markers in machine learning (ML) based diagnosis and prognosis of cognitive impairment and dementia, and identify both methodological changes over time and barriers to clinical translation.\n\nMETHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched for original studies that used both neuroimaging CSVD markers and ML methods for diagnosing and prognosing neurodegenerative diseases (preregistration in PROSPERO: CRD42022366767). Each paper was independently reviewed by a pair of reviewers at all stages, with a third consulted to resolve conflicts. We meta-analysed the effectiveness of ML models to distinguish healthy controls from Alzheimer’s dementia and cognitive impairment, using area under the curve (AUC) as the performance metric.\n\nRESULTS: We identified 75 studies: 43 on diagnosis, 27 on prognosis, and 5 on both. Nearly 60% of studies were published in the past two years, reflecting a growing interest in using CSVD markers in ML-based diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer’s dementia. This rising interest may be linked to the strong performance of such models: according to our meta-analysis, ML approaches using CSVD markers perform well in differentiating healthy controls from Alzheimer’s dementia (AUC 0.88 [95%-CI 0.85–0.92]) and cognitive impairment (AUC 0.84 [95%-CI 0.74–0.95]). However, the growing interest has not been matched by methodological rigour: only 16 studies met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis due to inconsistent reporting, only five assessed the generalisability of their models on external datasets, and six lacked clear diagnostic criteria.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Interest in incorporating CSVD markers into ML models for neurodegenerative disease classification is on the rise, and their performance suggests that this is worth further exploration. Serious methodological issues, including inconsistent reporting, limited generalisability testing, and other potential biases, are unfortunately common and hinder further adoption. Our targeted recommendations provide a roadmap to accelerate the integration of ML into clinical practice.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13195-025-01815-6.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diffusion Tensor Imaging along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) has emerged as a measure of cerebral interstitial fluid dynamics, a proposed component of the glymphatic system, which may provide insight into central nervous system fluid transport and waste clearance.\n\nPURPOSE: Our study aimed to evaluate whether DTI-ALPS can serve as a reliable, noninvasive imaging biomarker of altered interstitial fluid dynamics across the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) continuum.\n\nDATA SOURCES: We searched Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed for articles published through October 2024.\n\nSTUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they reported the ALPS-index in AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy control groups. Studies were excluded if they lacked sufficient data or involved overlapping cohorts.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS: Using standardized mean difference (SMD), we compared the ALPS-index in AD and MCI groups to healthy controls. We assessed the association between the ALPS index and cognitive function using a random-effects model. A qualitative risk bias assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall ALPS index was significantly lower in AD subjects than in healthy controls (SMD = -1.07, 95% CI: -1.57 to -0.56). Statistically significant differences were also observed between AD and MCI subjects (SMD = -0.25, 95% CI: -0.40 to -0.10), as well as between MCI and healthy control subjects (SMD = -0.81, 95% CI: -1.57 to 0.06). Additionally, the ALPS index showed a statistically significant association with Mini-Mental State Examination scores (pooled correlation effect size = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.57). A negative correlation was also observed between the ALPS index and amyloid deposition on PET, with a pooled correlation effect size of -0.42 (95% CI: -0.66 to -0.19, p < 0.001).\n\nLIMITATIONS: Potential limitations include heterogeneity across imaging protocols, variability in cognitive assessments, and possible publication bias.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The DTI-ALPS technique showed significant differences among cognitive groups across the AD continuum and was associated with cognitive scores and brain amyloidosis. This provides further evidence that DTI-ALPS could be useful in detecting altered cerebral interstitial fluid dynamics in MCI and AD.\n\nABBREVIATIONS: AD＝ Alzheimer's disease; Aβ＝ beta-amyloid; PET＝ positron emission tomography; PiB＝ Pittsburgh Compound B; FBB＝ Florbetaben; CL＝ Centiloid.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: African American individuals have a higher risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementia (ADRD) than non-Hispanic White individuals. Some cross-sectional studies with self-reported race and ethnicity have reported racial differences in circulating ADRD biomarkers, including phosphorylated tau181 (p-Tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL). We aimed to examine the associations of genetically inferred African ancestry proportion with the longitudinal changes in these biomarkers and to evaluate the associations of previously identified ADRD-related genetic factors in European cohorts with these biomarkers in an African American cohort.\n\nMETHODS: This study used longitudinal data from the Family and Community Health Study, which was initiated in 1996, recruited and followed 889 African American families residing in Georgia and Iowa. Circulating p-Tau181, GFAP, and NfL were measured in serum samples collected in 2008 (wave 5) and 2019 (wave 8). Closely related individuals, genetically inferred to be third-degree relatives or closer, were excluded. Genetic ancestry proportions were inferred using the ADMIXTURE analysis. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to test the associations of African ancestry proportion with cross-sectional biomarker levels and their longitudinal changes over 11 years. We also tested the associations of selected genetic variants, polygenic scores, and APOE ε4 status with these biomarkers.\n\nRESULTS: Our cross-sectional sample included 573 participants (mean age = 55.1 years; 69% female), whereas our longitudinal sample included 225 (57.2 years; 80% female). African ancestry proportion was not associated with cross-sectional biomarker levels but was inversely associated with the longitudinal change in p-Tau181 (β = -14.50 pg/mL, p = 0.02). The significant inverse association was robust to adjustment for age, sex, APOE ε4, socioeconomic status, physical activity, smoking, subjective cognitive decline, and various cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities. Finally, genetic factors associated with AD and biomarkers in European cohorts were not associated with the 3 biomarkers in our African American cohort.\n\nDISCUSSION: We found suggestive evidence that a higher African ancestry proportion is associated with an attenuated increase in the blood p-Tau181 level over time. More research is needed to characterize the longitudinal dynamics of ADRD biomarkers across ancestry and the driving biological or sociocultural factors.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with ischemic stroke accounting for the majority of cases. Advances in reperfusion therapies, including intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and mechanical thrombectomy (MT), have significantly improved outcomes for acute ischemic stroke patients. However, reperfusion brain injury (RBI), a paradoxical consequence of recanalization, poses a major challenge, driven by oxidative stress, inflammation, and blood-brain barrier disruption. This review critically examines emerging therapeutic strategies to mitigate RBI, focusing on pharmacological agents such as edaravone, NXY-059, and tenecteplase, as well as procedural innovations in thrombectomy.\n\nMETHODS: This review employed a systematic search of databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Scopus using certain keywords. A comparative analysis of thrombolysis and thrombectomy was done, and emerging techniques and drugs mitigating reperfusion brain injury (RBI) were discussed.\n\nRESULTS: Thrombolysis and thrombectomy highlight key differences in efficacy, safety, and patient selection criteria. While thrombectomy demonstrates superior outcomes in large vessel occlusions (LVOs), thrombolysis remains a cornerstone for early intervention where thrombectomy is inaccessible. Essential drugs like NXY-059, edaravone, uric acid, N-acetylcysteine, and others are changing the care of RBI after stroke. Newer thrombectomy techniques and technologies are also promising. However, the evident efficacy of these methods is still inconsistent in various patients. While thrombectomy and thrombolysis have the potential to cause post-stroke cognitive decline, thrombectomy leads to better outcomes, but patient-specific factors such as age, previous medical history, infarct volume, and others must be considered. Neurorehabilitation is essential for patient recovery from post-stroke cognitive decline. Strategies such as the use of gas-mediated therapies, pharmacological agents, stem cell therapies, antioxidant nanomedicines, and modulation of specific proteins like sirtuins are emerging treatment techniques and are promising to change the narration of RBI management and impact patient outcomes.\n\nCONCLUSION: The review underscores the need for precision medicine approaches, improved imaging for patient selection, and comprehensive longitudinal studies to optimize reperfusion strategies. Targeted interventions addressing oxidative damage and inflammation hold promise for reducing RBI and improving long-term patient outcomes.",

A total of 372 patients with acute ischemic stroke and salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging were enrolled between June 21, 2021, and June 30, 2024 (final follow-up October 2, 2024). Eligibility criteria included stroke onset (or the midpoint between last known well and symptom recognition if onset was unknown) of 4.5 to 24 hours prior to presentation, and no initial plan for endovascular thrombectomy. Data were analyzed from December 2024 to February 2025.\n\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a minimization algorithm to receive intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg; maximum dose, 90 mg; n = 186) or standard medical treatment (n = 186).\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcome was functional independence, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at 90 days. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours and all-cause mortality within 90 days.\n\nRESULTS: Among 372 patients who were enrolled (median [IQR] age, 72 [64-80] years; 160 [43%] women), all completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 75 of 186 patients (40%) in the alteplase group and 49 of 186 (26%) in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.14-2.02]; P = .004; unadjusted risk difference, 13.98% [95% CI, 4.50%-23.45%]). The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was higher with alteplase at 3.8% compared with 0.51% with standard treatment (adjusted risk ratio, 7.34 [95% CI, 1.54-34.84]; P = .01; unadjusted risk difference, 3.23% [0.28%-6.19%]), and mortality was 11% in both groups (adjusted risk ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.52-1.62]; P = .76; unadjusted risk difference, 0% [95% CI, -6.30% to 6.30%]).\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with acute ischemic stroke with salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging who did not initially receive thrombectomy, intravenous alteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after onset provided functional benefit, despite an increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04879615.",

        "Abstract": "Sortilin, a type I transmembrane protein encoded by SORT1 and part of the VPS10-domain receptor family, is crucial for intracellular trafficking and APP processing in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It promotes protective α-secretase cleavage to prevent Aβ formation and aids Aβ clearance. However, under certain conditions, sortilin can become neurotoxic, causing Aβ buildup, tau phosphorylation, protein misrouting, and apoptosis, which accelerate neuronal damage and cognitive decline. No longitudinal human studies have yet explored how plasma and CSF Aβ42 predict plasma sortilin across the AD spectrum or whether whole-brain volume mediates the relationship between plasma sortilin and cognitive impairment. This study aimed to clarify these relationships and assess plasma sortilin as an indicator of central and peripheral amyloid pathology in AD for future experimental research. The results showed that at baseline, CSF Aβ42 levels were significantly lower in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD compared to controls, while plasma Aβ42 levels did not differ, and sortilin levels were significantly reduced in MCI versus controls but not between other groups. Over 12 months, plasma sortilin levels declined in cognitively normal (CN) individuals but increased in MCI and AD, plasma Aβ42 rose across all groups, and CSF Aβ42 decreased modestly, highlighting diagnosis-specific sortilin changes and differing plasma versus CSF Aβ42 dynamics. Solely in MCI, higher plasma and CSF Aβ42 independently predicted increased plasma sortilin levels over time, indicating both peripheral and central Aβ42 contribute to sortilin upregulation, but when both were elevated simultaneously, the sortilin increase was attenuated, suggesting a non-linear or compensatory response. At the 12-month time point, higher plasma sortilin levels were negatively associated with whole-brain volume in MCI. In contrast, higher plasma Aβ42 levels showed positive associations with whole-brain volume in both CN and MCI groups, while no such association was observed in AD. CSF Aβ42 was not significantly related to brain volume in any group. Notably, at the 12-month time point in MCI, higher plasma sortilin levels were associated with poorer cognitive performance indirectly via reduced whole-brain volume; this mediation effect was not observed in CN or AD groups. Thus, plasma and CSF Aβ42 levels predict plasma sortilin levels, which may contribute to brain volume reduction and subsequent cognitive impairment, highlighting sortilin as a potential mediator or early indicator of neurodegeneration in AD progression.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pathogenic variants in LRRK2 lead to increased kinase activity, and LRRK2 kinase inhibition is being explored in clinical studies as a therapeutic approach for Parkinson's Disease (PD). LRRK2 inhibitors reduce urine levels of bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP), a key endolysosomal lipid involved in glycosphingolipid (GSL) catabolism, in preclinical models and clinical subjects. However, how LRRK2 regulates BMP and its significance with respect to lysosomal dysfunction in PD are poorly defined.\n\nMETHODS: Using a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to modulate LRRK2 kinase activity, we explored the mechanisms by which LRRK2 can regulate the levels of BMP and PD-relevant GSLs across cellular models, including iPSC-derived microglia, and in tissues and biofluids from mice using mass spectrometry. The impact of LRRK2 activity on various aspects of lysosomal function, including endolysosomal GCase activity, was assessed using live-cell imaging and lysosomal immunoprecipitation. We employed imaging mass-spectrometry and FACS-based methods to specifically examine how LRRK2 modulates BMP and GSL levels across different cell types and regions of the brain. To confirm the relevance of our findings to disease, we measured lysosomal biomarkers in urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from human subjects carrying variants in LRRK2 associated with PD risk and from subjects dosed with a LRRK2 kinase inhibitor.\n\nRESULTS: Our data demonstrate that LRRK2 can employ distinct mechanisms to control intracellular BMP levels and modulate lysosomal homeostasis depending on the tissue examined. We show that LRRK2 deletion or inhibition lowers urine BMP levels by reducing the secretion of BMP-containing vesicles from kidney into urine. In other cell types such as microglia, LRRK2-mediated inhibition of β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), a PD-linked enzyme involved in GSL catabolism, leads to lysosomal GSL accumulation and increases BMP levels as a compensatory response to restore lysosomal homeostasis. LRRK2 inhibition normalizes lysosomal function and reduces GSL levels in preclinical models and CSF from LRRK2-PD patients.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the therapeutic potential of LRRK2 kinase inhibition to improve PD-associated lysosomal dysfunction and supports the utility of GSLs as CSF-based biomarkers of LRRK2 activity.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This work includes results from the following phase 1b study in PD patients: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03710707; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03710707?intr=dnl201&rank=2 .

        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The choroid plexus (CP), a critical structure for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production, has been increasingly recognized for its involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accurate segmentation of CP from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains challenging due to its irregular shape, variable MR signal, and proximity to the lateral ventricles. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a region-informed Gaussian Mixture Model (One-GMM) for automatic CP segmentation using anatomical priors derived from FreeSurfer (FS) software and compare it with manual, FS, and one previous GMM-based (Two-GMM) methods.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI scans were acquired from 38 participants [19 cognitively normal (CN)], 11 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 8 with AD. Manual segmentations served as ground truth. A GMM was applied within an anatomically constrained region combining the lateral ventricles and CP derived from FS reconstruction. The segmentation accuracy was assessed using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), and volume difference percentage (VD%). Results were compared with those from FS and one previous GMM method-based segmentations across diagnostic groups.\n\nRESULTS: The region-informed One-GMM achieved significantly higher accuracy compared to FS and Two-GMM, with a mean DSC of 0.82 ± 0.05 for One-GMM versus 0.24 ± 0.11 for FS (p  <  0.001), and 0.66 ± 0.10 for Two-GMM (p < 0.001), lower HD95 (One-GMM: 6.06 ± 10.32 mm vs. FS: 26.21 ± 7.32 mm vs. Two-GMM: 10.58 ± 6.47 mm), and comparable volume difference (One-GMM: 20.97 ± 9.53% vs. FS: 24.32 ± 28.13% vs. Two-GMM: 24.27 ± 22.10, p = 0.87). Segmentation accuracy of our proposed method was consistent across all diagnostic groups. Clinical analysis showed that there is no diagnostic group difference in CP volume obtained from manual, FS, Two-GMM, and our proposed One-GMM methods. In the whole cohort, there are also no age and sex effects of CP volume with all methods. Restricting to the CN group, CP volume from both manual (p = 0.03), Two-GMM (p < 0.01) and the proposed One-GMM (p = 0.05), methods show an aging effect, but not for the FS segmented CP volume (p = 0.22).\n\nCONCLUSION: A region-informed One-GMM method significantly improved CP segmentation accuracy over FS, providing a practical and accessible tool for CP quantification in AD and other research studies. Within this small cohort, no diagnostic group difference in CP volume was observed. An aging effect of CP volume was found within the CN group.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. Recently, plasma biomarkers, particularly p-tau217, have emerged as promising tools for early diagnosis and risk stratification. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of p-tau217 combined with other plasma biomarkers in distinguishing Aβ Positron emission tomography (PET) positivity in cognitively unimpaired (CU) and cognitively impaired (CI) individuals across diverse clinical subgroups.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed 2,497 participants from the Korea-Registries to Overcome dementia and Accelerate Dementia (K-ROAD) cohort, including 636 CU and 1,971 CI individuals. Plasma p-tau217 was measured using both SIngle MOlecule Array (SIMOA) and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assays, alongside Aβ42/40, Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and Neurofilament light chain (NfL). We assessed the diagnostic performance of biomarker combinations for Aβ PET positivity through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and performed subgroup analyses based on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status. To assess applicability, we stratified the cohort by recruitment site into a development set (Samsung Medical Center, n = 1,545) and a validation set (other centers, n = 952).\n\nRESULTS: In CU individuals from the development cohort, the combination of p-tau217 and Aβ42/40 significantly improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC: ALZpath 0.937 vs. 0.905, MSD 0.901 vs. 0.861; p < 0.05, DeLong test; 95% CIs) and model fit (AIC /BIC, p < 0.001) compared to p-tau217 alone. In contrast, in CI individuals, the combination provided only modest improvements in model fit without significantly enhancing AUC. GFAP and NfL did not contribute significantly to amyloid detection in either group. These findings were successfully validated in an independent cohort from other centers. Subgroup analyses in CU individuals showed the greatest improvements in older adults, females, and APOE4 non-carriers, regardless of obesity status. In CI individuals, the combination had no significant impact on AUC except in males, where a small but significant increase was observed (p = 0.002).\n\nCONCLUSION: Combining p-tau217 with Aβ42/40 enhances amyloid detection in CU individuals, improving both diagnostic accuracy and model fit, whereas its impact in CI individuals is limited. These results highlight the potential of plasma biomarker combinations for refining early AD diagnostics and individualized risk assessment.",

        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor slowing (bradykinesia), which is thought to arise mainly due to nigro-striatal dopaminergic cell loss. Paradoxically, longitudinal changes in striatal dopamine relate poorly to the progression of bradykinesia, indicating that other pathophysiological mechanisms play a role. In line with this, cross-sectional studies have shown that more benign motor phenotypes of PD are characterized by increased activity in the parieto-premotor cortex, indicative of cerebral compensation. However, the role of cerebral compensation in disease progression remains unclear. Here, we used a longitudinal design to test the hypothesis that the clinical progression of bradykinesia in PD is related to a decline in compensatory parieto-premotor function, over and above worsening nigro-striatal cell loss. We used a validated action selection task in combination with functional MRI to measure motor- and selection-related brain activity relative to the most-affected hand in a large sample of 351 PD patients (≤5 years disease duration) and 60 healthy controls. In addition, we used diffusion-weighted MRI to obtain structural indices of substantia nigra and cerebral cortex integrity. These measurements were acquired at baseline and at two-year follow-up, enabling us to compare longitudinal changes in brain metrics between patients and controls, and to investigate their relationships with clinical metrics of bradykinesia progression. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that bradykinesia progression was inversely related to longitudinal changes in selection-related dorsal premotor cortex activity, suggesting that faster loss of cortical compensation contributes to faster symptom worsening. Importantly, this relationship remained after adjusting for longitudinal changes in the functional and structural integrity of the nigro-striatal system, indicating that bradykinesia progression is uniquely determined by loss of cortical compensation. In group comparisons of longitudinal change, PD patients showed an overall reduction in putamen activity, which did not decrease further over time, in combination with an acceleration of structural decline in the substantia nigra and the premotor cortex. Despite showing expected patterns of PD pathology, neither of these metrics correlated with bradykinesia progression. We conclude that the progression of bradykinesia in PD is determined by longitudinal changes in compensatory premotor cortex function. This presents opportunities to develop new progression-slowing interventions that focus on preserving and enhancing cortical compensation.",

        "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Sex differences may contribute to disparities in dementia outcomes.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To understand the association between sex and mortality and health care services use after dementia diagnosis.\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide cohort study used Medicare enrollment data and took place from 2014 to 2021 with up to 8 years of follow-up. Analysis was performed from April 2024 to April 2025. This study included 5 721 711 patients 65 years or older with International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision diagnosis codes for dementia with at least 1 year of prior fee-for-service Medicare enrollment.\n\nEXPOSURES: Sex, determined from Medicare enrollment data, derived from Social Security Administration records.\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was hazard of all-cause mortality, estimated with Cox proportional hazard regression. Secondary outcomes included hazards of use of common health care services, such as all-cause hospitalizations, skilled nursing facility stays, receipt of neuroimaging services, and physical/occupational therapy.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 5 721 711 patients (3 302 579 female and 2 419 132 male) with incident dementia between 2014 and 2021 were included in the study. Female patients had lower crude 1-year mortality rates (21.8% vs 27.2% for male patients; P < .001) and lower rates of all-cause hospitalizations (46.9% vs 50.5%; P < .001). The unadjusted hazard of death associated with male sex was 1.30 (95% CI, 1.29-1.31; P < .001). After adjustment for age, race and ethnicity, Medicaid dual eligibility, medical comorbidity burden, and access to health care resources, the association was modestly attenuated (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.23-1.26; P < .001). Similarly, the unadjusted hazard ratio of all-cause hospitalization associated with male sex was 1.13 (95% CI, 1.12-1.14; P < .001); the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.08 (95% CI, 1.08-1.09; P < .001). Male patients also had increased hazards of hospice stay, neuroimaging services, and hospitalization for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis or behavioral disturbance.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, male patients with dementia had higher mortality rates and higher use of many health care services, especially hospital stays, than comparable female patients. Strategies to slow mortality and decrease health care use among male patients with dementia may be particularly impactful in limiting the burden of dementia. Given higher incidence of dementia among women, a focus on efforts to prevent dementia is necessary to achieve population-level health equity in dementia-attributable mortality by sex.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although edaravone dexborneol, a multitarget cytoprotective drug, has demonstrated benefits in previous clinical trials, its actual clinical efficacy and safety in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remain unclear. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that edaravone dexborneol is associated with better outcomes in patients with AIS in real-world clinical practice.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, real-world cohort study at 72 centers in China from January 14 to July 4, 2023. We included patients age 18 years or older, with AIS within 14 days of onset, and a prestroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0 or 1. Patients were divided into those receiving edaravone dexborneol (the exposed group) or not (the unexposed group). Clinical outcomes included favorable functional outcome (mRS score 0-1) at 90 days, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) during the hospital, and all-cause mortality within 90 days. Multivariable logistic regression, propensity score matching (PSM), and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analyses were conducted.\n\nRESULTS: Of 4,401 participants (2,904 men [66.8%]; median [interquartile range] age, 65 [57-72] years), 3,017 (68.6%) were treated with edaravone dexborneol. The exposed group was younger (65 [56-72] years vs 66 [58-74] years), had higher NIH Stroke Scale (3 [2-7] vs 3 [1-5]), and had shorter time from onset to admission (7.0 [2.5-24.0] hours vs 10.4 [2.8-48.0] hours). The exposed group had a higher proportion of patients with favorable functional outcome at 90 days compared with the unexposed group (68.6% [2,071/3,017] vs 66.0% [914/1,384], adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.23 [95% CI 1.06-1.43]). Moreover, sICH rates (0.4% vs 0.6%, aOR 0.44 [95% CI 0.14-1.44]) and mortality within 90 days (2.1% vs 3.3%, adjusted hazard ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.58-1.37]) were similar in both groups. PSM and IPTW analyses yielded results consistent with the multivariate adjustment model.\n\nDISCUSSION: In this observational cohort study involving Chinese patients with AIS, edaravone dexborneol was associated with significantly better functional outcome at 90 days. Verification of our findings is warranted in other populations.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: This trial is registered with Effectiveness and Safety of Edaravone Dexborneol in Acute Ischemic Stroke, number NCT05644223; submitted for registration on November 30, 2022; first patient enrollment was on January 14, 2023.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that treatment of patients with AIS with edaravone dexborneol is associated with significantly better functional outcome at 90 days measured using the mRS.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires early intervention at preclinical stages like subjective memory complaints (SMC). Traditional static brain network analyses lack sensitivity to detect early functional disruptions in SMC. This study aimed to improve preclinical AD stratification by integrating dynamic gray-white matter functional connectivity (DFC) and machine learning.\n\nMETHODS: Using multi-cohort ADNI data [N = 1,415 participants across cognitive normal[CN], SMC, and cognitive impairment [CI]groups],dynamic functional networks were constructed via sliding-window analysis (20-50 TR windows, 98% overlap) of 200 gray matter (Schaefer atlas) and 128 data-driven white matter nodes. DFC metrics (standard deviation of Fisher z-transformed correlations) were used to identify group differences and classify AD spectrum stages. Support vector machine (SVM) models were trained to differentiate CN/SMC/CI, with subgroup analyses in Aβ + and APOE E4 + populations.\n\nRESULTS: DFC with short sliding windows (20-50 TRs, 98% overlap) demonstrated greater sensitivity than SFC in detecting early functional disruptions in gray-white matter networks, identifying 34 CN-SMC [p < 0.05, e.g., ventral attention network (VAN)-white matter 2 (WM2) via Gau20-DFC], 44 CN-CI (p < 0.001), and 49 SMC-CI (p < 0.01) differential connections. Key early abnormalities were identified in the anterior cingulate network (WM4) and sensorimotor network (WM5), with WM4-WM5 disconnections in Aβ + subgroups strongly correlated with Aβ deposition and APOE ε4 genotype. Dynamic graph theory models using SVM achieved superior AD spectrum classification (ADNI2/3 AUCs: 0.85-0.92 vs. static 0.77-0.87), particularly in Aβ + subgroups (ΔAUC = 0.15 for SMC+/CI + discrimination, p < 0.001), with the VAN-WM2 feature in short-window DFC strongly correlating with cognitive scales (MMSE: r = 0.40, p < 10-11; CDR-SB: r = -0.41, p < 10-12). Window function type (e.g., Gau20 for early changes, Ham50 for late stability) and data sampling points influenced sensitivity, with short windows optimizing early detection and long windows capturing late-stage network degeneration. These findings establish dynamic gray-white matter connectivity, particularly WM4-WM5 disruptions and VAN-WM2/DMN-WM8 features, as sensitive preclinical AD biomarkers enabled by machine learning for early SMC stratification.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study confirms that dynamic gray-white matter connectivity serves as a sensitive biomarker for preclinical Alzheimer's disease. The WM4-WM5 disruption hub and machine learning framework provide effective tools for early stratification of SMC, facilitating timely intervention within the disease's therapeutic window.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The benefit of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is believed to decrease with age. We aimed to compare disease outcomes with DMTs between patients with late-onset RRMS (LO-RRMS) and adult-onset RRMS (AO-RRMS).\n\nMETHODS: This was a single-center, longitudinal, prospective analysis of patients who fulfilled the following criteria: (1) a diagnosis of RRMS and (2) initiation of a new DMT (dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, and ocrelizumab) within 3 months. Patients were followed up at years 1 and 2. We compared treatment outcomes (relapses, radiologic activity, disability progression, and no evidence of disease activity [NEDA]) between LO-RRMS (defined as age at onset of first symptom >45 years) and AO-RRMS (≥18 years and 45 years) using Poisson, logistic, and Cox regression models while adjusting for baseline variables. The analyses were repeated with an age cutoff of 50 years.\n\nRESULTS: We studied 1,494 patients with AO-RRMS (mean age at onset: 29.6 years, 71% female) and 150 patients with LO-RRMS (50.2 years, 73% female) at treatment initiation. At DMT commencement, patients with LO-RRMS had shorter disease duration, higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), more comorbidities, and were more likely to be treatment naive than patients with AO-RRMS. However, when adjusted, there were no differences in the probability of relapses (Coeff = -0.07; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.04, p = 0.24), EDSS progression (odds ratio [OR] 1.43, 95% CI 0.69-2.93, p = 0.33), MRI activity (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.21-2.83, p = 0.70), and losing NEDA status (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93; 95% CI 0.73-1.18, p = 0.58) at year 1. Similar results were observed at year 2 in relapses (Coeff = -0.04; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.11, p = 0.60), EDSS progression (OR 1.33; 95% CI 0.69-2.93, p = 0.33), MRI activity (OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.38-4.38, p = 0.67), and loss of NEDA status (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.77-1.26, p = 0.96). Similar results were observed using an age cutoff of 50 years. The percentages of patients who stopped DMTs because of side effects were similar between AO-RRMS and LO-RRMS.\n\nDISCUSSION: Treatment outcomes over 2 years were similar between LO-RRMS and AO-RRMS. This indicates that care should be taken not to bias treatment decisions due to older age at onset of MS when patients demonstrate evidence of inflammatory activity. Limitations are the observational design, the single-center setting, and a relatively small LO-RRMS group.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that patients with LO-RRMS have comparable outcomes with DMTs as patients with AO-RRMS over a 2-year period; this rating is because of baseline imbalances between treatment groups and a nonmasked outcome assessment.",

Understanding this relationship is essential for developing interventions to reduce dementia risk.\n\nOBJECTIVES: We investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between blood pressure and AD biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and amyloid (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) in cognitively unimpaired adults.\n\nDESIGN: Prospective observational study.\n\nSETTING: We analyzed data from cognitively unimpaired participants from three observational prospective European studies: ALFA+ (NCT02485730), EPAD-LCS (NCT02804789), and AMYPAD PNHS (EudraCT: 2018-002,277-22).\n\nMEASUREMENTS: ALFA+ participants had either CSF biomarkers (CSF Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181, t-tau) and/or Aβ PET data. EPAD participants had CSF biomarkers (CSF Aβ42, p-tau181, t-tau), and AMYPAD participants had Aβ PET data. All participants had available data about diabetes, use of hypertensive medication, and waist-to-hip ratio. Multivariable linear regression models were used to analyze cross-sectional associations between systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse pressure (PP) with CSF biomarkers or Aβ PET (Centiloid units, CL); longitudinal associations were tested by means of delta CL scores between baseline and follow-up to assess Aβ PET changes over time.\n\nRESULTS: We included 405 participants from ALFA+ (mean age 61.1 years; 60 % female), 1104 from EPAD (mean age 64.8 years; 59.1 % female), and 340 from AMYPAD (mean age 71.8 years; 60 % female). In ALFA+, DBP was negatively associated with CSF Aβ40 (p = 0.016) and p-tau181 (p = 0.050), while there was a non-significant trend towards a positive association between SBP and CL over time (p = 0.058). In EPAD, DBP was negatively associated with CSF Aβ42 (p < 0.001) and p-tau181 (p = 0.014), while PP was positively associated with CSF Aβ42 (p = 0.024). In AMYPAD, SBP (p = 0.002) and PP (p = 0.003) were positively associated with CL at baseline, with a similar non-significant trend being found for DBP (p = 0.089). Higher DBP (p = 0.042) was significantly associated to increased CL over time, with a similar non-significant trend being found for SBP (p = 0.072). We did not find significant associations between blood pressure and longitudinal changes in CSF biomarkers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Elevated blood pressure was associated with increased Aβ PET accumulation in cognitively unimpaired individuals. Further research is warranted to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the negative associations between DBP and CSF biomarkers, which do not reflect the typical AD molecular signature. These findings highlight the relevance of high blood pressure as a potential risk factor for cognitive decline.",

        "Abstract": "The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is related to a variety of social misbehaviors, including criminal behavior (CB) due to deep changes in cognition, behavior, and personality. Recent work suggests that impairment in emotional processing, along with disinhibition, constitutes the necessary elements for CB in bvFTD. However, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are still unclear. Therefore, we aim at investigating structural and functional brain changes related to CB in bvFTD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the German Consortium for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD). Our study comprised 87 patients with bvFTD and 26 healthy controls recruited within different locations of the FTLD Consortium. A subset of 21 patients with bvFTD showed CB, including theft, physical violence, sexual assault, drug abuse, and violations against traffic law. Voxel-based morphometry was performed, generating gray matter density (GMD) images obtained from high-resolution T1-weighted MR images. In addition, surface-based morphometry was performed by reconstruction of cortical thickness using a projection-based thickness approach. Both GMD and cortical thickness were further analyzed in order to detect group differences between bvFTD with and without CB. Resting-state functional MRI was available for a subgroup of 56 patients with bvFTD, including 16 patients showing CB. On a behavioral level, CB in bvFTD was associated with a higher frequency of disinhibition, lower frequency of apathy, and better performance in verbal fluency. Comparing bvFTD with and without CB, we obtained reduced GMD and reduced cortical thickness in the temporal lobe, predominantly in the left hemisphere. Impairment in brain structure was correlated with the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale, particularly with disinhibition, in the left superior temporal gyrus in interaction with CB in bvFTD. Investigating functional MRI data, CB was associated with significant functional brain dysconnectivity, particularly between the left anterior superior temporal gyrus and widely distributed cortical regions, including areas in the vicinity of the precentral sulcus and the inferior frontal junction, related to executive functions. Our study revealed structural and functional brain differences between bvFTD with and without CB, showing CB-related reduced GMD and cortical thickness in the left temporal lobe, indicating disinhibition as the main driver for CB. Interestingly, brain degeneration in the temporal lobe is discussed with CB in bvFTD in the current literature, dominantly affecting the right hemisphere. Our study investigates specifically the neural correlates of CB in bvFTD with MRI, modifying this view. Further work is necessary to shed more light on the role of the temporal lobe in bvFTD with CB.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common neurological disorder that has a major negative influence on productivity loss and quality of life. Significant socioeconomic consequences are associated with the condition, such as decreased productivity at work and increased medical expenses. The frequency is higher in women, especially in reproductive age, and the burden varies globally. In India, the prevalence of migraine is 25%; this is higher than the global prevalence of 14.7%. The scoping review is undertaken with an aim to synthesize existing literature that summarizes the impact of migraine on productivity among working professionals, with a focus on its determinants in India.\n\nMETHODS: A systematic scoping review, with a comprehensive search strategy, was conducted across major databases. Eligibility criteria for studies to be included focused on prevalence, economic and observational studies involving adults aged 18 and older diagnosed with migraines. Studies conducted from January 2014 to October 2024 in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) were included. Data extraction was standardized, capturing key study characteristics. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the JBI score checklist for the assessment of cross-sectional and prevalence studies. The pooled estimates for productivity loss were collated from individual studies and adjusted per capita national income. This pooled productivity loss was used to estimate the per day economic loss based on per capita income.\n\nRESULTS: The systematic search identified 11 relevant articles for LMICs that provided insights into the impact of migraines on productivity and economic outcomes. The evidence highlighted that migraine-related productivity losses ranged from 3% to 4.3% of productive time, translating to significant financial implications. Evidence from India suggests one-year prevalence of migraines is approximately 14.12% to 28.99%, affecting around 213 million cases annually. The pooled analysis obtained from two studies shows that productivity loss due to migraine is 17.3 days per year. This was found to be INR 8731/- annually based on daily per capita income. Taking the prevalence of migraine in India, it leads to a total economic loss of about INR 18,674.35 crore (approximately USD 22.21 billion). This significant burden emphasizes the urgent need for effective healthcare interventions to address and manage migraine disorders in the population.\n\nCONCLUSION: Migraines impose a significant threat to the economy and productivity in India, especially for working professionals and women in their prime working years. Addressing migraine as a public health priority through awareness, early diagnosis, and effective management will not only improve quality of life but also enhance national productivity and economic growth of the country.",

        "Abstract": "The link between regional tau load and clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) highlights the importance of characterizing spatial tau distribution across disease variants. In typical (memory-predominant) AD, the spatial progression of tau pathology mirrors the functional connections from temporal lobe epicenters. However, given the limited spatial heterogeneity of tau in typical AD, atypical (non-amnestic-predominant) AD variants with distinct tau patterns provide a key opportunity to investigate the universality of connectivity as a scaffold for tau progression. In this large-scale, multicenter study across 14 international sites, we included cross-sectional tau-PET data from 320 individuals with atypical AD (n=139 posterior cortical atrophy/PCA-AD; n=103 logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia/lvPPA-AD; n=35 behavioural variant AD/bvAD; n=43 corticobasal syndrome/CBS-AD), with a subset of individuals (n=78) having longitudinal tau-PET data. Additionally, as an independent sample, we included regional post-mortem tau stainings from 93 atypical AD patients from two sites (n=19 PCA-AD, n=32 lvPPA-AD, n=23 bvAD, n=19 CBS-AD). Gaussian mixture modeling was used to harmonize different tau-PET tracers by transforming tau-PET standardized uptake value ratios to tau positivity probabilities (a uniform scale ranging from 0% to 100%). Using linear regression, we assessed whether brain regions with stronger resting-state fMRI-based functional connectivity, derived from healthy elderly controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), showed greater covariance in cross-sectional and longitudinal tau-PET and post-mortem tau pathology. Furthermore, we examined whether functional connectivity of tau-PET epicenters (i.e., the top 5% of regions with the highest baseline tau load) and tau-PET accumulation epicenters (i.e., the top 5% of regions with the highest tau accumulation rates) was associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal tau patterns. Our findings show that tau-PET epicenters aligned with clinical variants, e.g. a visual network predominant pattern in PCA-AD ('visual AD') and left-hemispheric temporal predominance, particularly within the language network, in lvPPA-AD ('language AD'). Moreover, more strongly functionally connected regions showed correlated concurrent tau-PET levels (confirmed with post-mortem data) and tau-PET accumulation rates. The functional connectivity profile of tau-PET epicenters and accumulation epicenters corresponded to tau-PET progression patterns, with higher tau-PET levels and accumulation rates in functionally close regions, and lower tau-PET levels and accumulation rates in functionally distant regions. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that tau propagation occurs along functional connections originating from local epicenters, across all AD clinical variants. Since tau proteinopathy is a major driver of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, this finding may advance personalized medicine and participant-specific endpoints in clinical trials.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that significantly impacts patients' quality of life and disease progression. Despite its clinical importance, the underlying mechanisms linking motor and cognitive dysfunction in PD remain poorly understood. Wearable sensor technology offers an innovative approach to quantifying gait parameters and exploring their relationship with cognitive decline, providing a non-invasive, objective method to identify individuals at risk of cognitive impairment.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a diagnostic model using gait parameters derived from wearable sensors to predict cognitive impairment in PD patients. Additionally, it sought to integrate these findings with machine learning methods to enhance prediction accuracy.\n\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on early-to-mid-stage PD patients, with approximately 28.8% diagnosed with cognitive impairment. A total of 38 clinically relevant variables were collected, including demographic data, medical history, cognitive scale scores, and gait data captured by wearable sensors. Baseline comparisons, univariate, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for cognitive impairment. Selected variables were used to train and evaluate six machine-learning models. The models' predictive performance was comprehensively assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC) values, decision curve analysis (DCA), calibration curves, precision-recall (PR) curves, and forest plots. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was also employed to enable personalized risk assessment. Finally, correlations between cognitive scores (MoCA and MMSE) and key gait parameters were analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Among the 38 clinical variables, seven were identified as independent risk factors for cognitive impairment in PD, including Duration of PD, UPDRS-III score, Step Length, Walk speed, Stride time, Peak arm angular velocity, Peak angular velocity during steering. The logistic regression model demonstrated superior predictive performance (test set AUC: 0.957), outperforming other machine learning algorithms. SHAP analysis revealed that Step Length, UPDRS-III score, Duration of PD, and Peak angular velocity during steering were the most influential predictors in the logistic regression model. Additionally, correlation analysis showed a significant association between lower cognitive scores and deteriorating gait parameters.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of gait parameters derived from wearable sensors as biomarkers for cognitive impairment in PD patients. It also underscores the intricate interplay between motor and cognitive dysfunction in PD. The integration of gait analysis with machine learning models, particularly logistic regression, provides a robust, non-invasive, and scalable approach for early identification and risk stratification of cognitive decline in PD. By leveraging wearable technology, this work paves the way for innovative diagnostic strategies to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.",
